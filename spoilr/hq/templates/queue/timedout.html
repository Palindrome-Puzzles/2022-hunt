    Sorry, slowpoke.  You didn't finish in time and we thought you were idle.  If you were actually on the phone with the team (or still are), try to claim that team again.  If that doesn't work, try to pass on what you did to whomever does claim them.  Either way, you'll need to go <a href=".">back to the queue</a>.
