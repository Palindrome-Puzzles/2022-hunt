<p>Physical puzzles have started to ship out, and we have plenty of the envelopes. As the captain of a medium or large sized team, weâ€™d like to offer you some more discount codes for the envelope to share with your team. Like before, these can be used on our <a href="https://mitmysteryhunt2022.myshopify.com">Shopify store</a> to bring the price of an envelope down to $0, so that you just pay for shipping.</p>

<p>All envelopes are identical, and you do not need additional copies for solving. Providing these additional copies just lets even more members of your team have the physical items.</p>

<p>This code can be used {{Code quantity}} times: {{Envelope code}}</p>

<p>As your team's captain, you are the only member of your team receiving this email. You are responsible for distributing this code to your team as appropriate.</p>

Thanks,<br>
