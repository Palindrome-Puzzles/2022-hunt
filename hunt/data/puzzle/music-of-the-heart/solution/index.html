<p>In the well-known Broadway musical "Into the Woods", the character of the Baker's Wife was originated by <span class="answer">JOANNA GLEASON</span>.</p>

    <h2>Author's Notes</h2>
    <p>The genesis of this puzzle came from listening to Broadway soundtracks, and appreciating some of the unusual words that lyricists managed to use … words like VERDIGRIS (which made it into the puzzle), and BLOVIATE and IN LOCO PARENTIS (which didn't). I first envisioned it as a possible meta puzzle, where the feeder puzzle answers would be the lyric words, and letters extracted from the song or show titles would give another lyric word, and the final answer would be another song or show title … but that didn't end up fitting with the final story and the kind of meta answers it needed.</p>
    <p>Once this puzzle had settled on the form you see here, construction was an intricate juggling act so that not only were all the lyric words unique, but no two songs were the same length or taken from the same show. A few times during testing, a word had to be taken out for one reason or another, and replacing it sometimes meant a cascade of changing several others to keep meeting all those constraints.</p>
