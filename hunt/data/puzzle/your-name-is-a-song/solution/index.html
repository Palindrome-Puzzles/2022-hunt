<h2>Author's Notes</h2>
<p>VALLICELLIANA was chosen for this puzzle as it was both the draggiest-sounding answer and because, as RuPaul says, "reading is what? Fundamental". Additionally, it plays into the trend of drag queens reading to children in libraries, which seemed very appropriate for a book-themed Mystery Hunt.</p>

<p>I also wanted to create a drag-focused puzzle that did not focus on RuPaul's Drag Race to express the idea that drag culture is bigger than what Drag Race portrays on TV. For the female artists chosen for this puzzle, I was careful to not choose Taylor Swift as there already exists too many puzzles and references to Taylor Swift in past puzzle hunts.</p>

<p>Special thanks go to Peter Gwinn, Sandy Weisz, Mark Halpin, Shai Nir Hana, Aaron Feldman, Ben Smith, and Eric Berlin for the advice and assistance on this puzzle.</p>
