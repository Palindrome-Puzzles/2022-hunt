<p>Upon answering a few of the easier or more obvious clues, you'll notice that they're all 3 or 4 letter initialisms, and this can guide you in your search for the less obvious answers.  You may also notice that the first set of clues has no apparent ordering, either in the clue phrases or the answers, while the second set has its clue phrases in alphabetical order.</p>
<p>After you've answered enough clues, you may notice that the final 2 or 3 letters of initialisms in the first set match the beginning 2 or 3 letters of those in the second set.  So match each overlapping pair in the order given by the first set.</p>

<p>Reading the final letter of the answers from the second set gives the clue phrase "Middle letter of SUV means". Since SUV stands for "Sport Utility Vehicle," the final answer is <span class="answer">UTILITY</span>.

<h2>Author's Notes</h2>
<p>(Tracy) This puzzle idea came from a <i>Jeopardy!</i> category. On the January 25, 2021 episode, the category "4-LETTER BEFORE &amp; AFTER" had clues and responses such as:</p> 
<dl>
	<dt>At the office that gives out driver's licenses, the star performer who brings the team to the top</dt>
	<dd>"What is DMVP?"</dd>
	<dt>The squeal of a teenage girl when she sees Leo the Lion &amp; realizes "Mrs. Miniver" or "Ben Hur" is on</dt>
	<dd>"What is OMGM?"</dd>
</dl>

<p>The first draft of this puzzle was written to a different answer and used an extraction method that made the construction much more highly constrained.  When the current answer UTILITY was assigned to this puzzle, Foggy basically rewrote the puzzle from scratch, simplifying and streamlining it to get us past that construction bottleneck. Debby added many clues and, as fate would have it, had a meeting with the MIT VPF not long after Debby had written the clue about her.</p>

<p>This puzzle is dedicated to the memory of my mother, <a href="https://www.peckfuneralhome.com/obituary/Helen-Cobbs" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">Helen Cobbs</a>, who was diagnosed with ovarian cancer and passed away during the writing of this Mystery Hunt. She was a <i>Jeopardy!</i> fan and she was as dedicated to protecting and providing for her children as the eponym of this puzzle, Mrs. Frisby.</p>
