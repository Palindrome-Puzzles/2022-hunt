<p>
  The scattered toys shown in the second image in the puzzle need to be separated into the 4 types of toys, and solving each set/part using the 4 given instructions in order as follows.
</p>

<h3>1) See characters from opposing viewpoint (Letter blocks)</h3>
<p>
  The 5 sets of letter blocks comprise blocks of 5 different colors with all 6 faces shown having different letters. This is clued by the similar letter blocks on the toy box image, which also shows different colored letter blocks with different letters on the faces. The aha, clued by the instruction, is that each given set of letter blocks is actually showing the opposite faces of the blocks, and in the reverse order right-to-left (ie. The required word/phrase is viewed correctly from the perspective of the girl behind the letter blocks).
</p>

<p>
  Hence the actual letter seen from the perspective of each girl is one of the other five letters of the same color block which is on the opposing face. The shorter words could be solved in the same manner as Dropquotes, and this will fix the position of more letters to help solve the longer words.
</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Green</th>
    <th>Red</th>
    <th>Purple</th>
    <th>Blue</th>
    <th>Orange</th>

    <td>YN</td>

  </tr>

<p>
  The words/phrases formed are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>PONYTAIL</li>
  <li>FRENCH SIDE BRAID</li>
  <li>BUNCHES</li>
  <li>TWISTED BUN</li>
  <li>FLOWER CROWN</li>
</ul>

<p>
  These match and are clued by the hair styles/accessory in the images of the 5 girls. So this helps as a confirmation while solving the words formed by the letter blocks. Each of the girls also has a numbered ordering, which give an ordering to these answers as above (which is used as the final ordering).
</p>

<h3>2) Collect your own cards (Flash cards)</h3>

<p>
  The 20 picture flash cards each represent a two-word phrase with the given enumerations, numbered in alphabetical order. Each of the five hair styles/accessory answer from the previous part references a word in four of the phrases (indicated in red below), which can then be collected by the corresponding girl as clued by the instruction, as summarized in the table below.
</p>

  </tr>

<h3>3) Stack unused things (Ring stackers)</h3>

<p>
  Besides the referenced word, each flash card phrase from the previous part has the other unused word (in red below). The lengths of these unused words, in each referenced grouping above, are 4 sequential numbers, so they can be stacked in ascending order like the ring stacker. The 5 ring stackers have numbered indices on each ring, with a left-right placement matching the position of the unused word in the two-word phrase. Hence the matching ring stacker for each grouping is the one which matches the pattern of the unused words in that grouping. Using the number on each ring to extract a letter from that corresponding length-ordered unused word gives 4 letters per grouping.

<h3>4) Fix broken toys (Wooden toys)</h3>

<p>
  The remaining 5 wooden toys all have five-letter names - C<span class="focus">L</span>OCK, TR<span class="focus">A</span>IN, <span class="focus">T</span>ILES, <span class="focus">H</span>ORSE, HOUS<span class="focus">E</span>. Each set of extracted four letters from the previous part is one of these words with a missing letter (shown in red). Taking the missing letters in order of the girls gives <span class="answer">LATHE</span>, the thematic answer for this puzzle.
