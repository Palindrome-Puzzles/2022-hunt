The world is full of stories, and now it’s time to make your mark with one of your own. An adaptation is the ideal way to go. After all, an adaptation is always just as well-respected as the original, assured to turn a profit, and has never once left audiences ruefully shaking their heads and saying things like “the book was better.”

Let’s not just do any old adaptation, however. Let’s make it pop. Sing. Glow. Maybe all at once, with the help of a special guest director or two (or at least a vague imitation thereof) and some spicy updates to the original work.

Lights, camera, action!
</div>

## Rules

Your adaptation will need to conform to a set of requirements.

### 1. Pick one book
Your movie may not include scenes from multiple books.

### 2. Choose 1-2 scenes
Each scene includes a list of required characters and a set of required content. You are free to add more characters and content if you wish. (See table for scene count.)

### 3. Mimic 1-2 directors
Each director has two required components. These components may involve dialogue, sound, action, or cinematography. Your video must include both required components for your chosen director(s).
You’re free to include more components beyond those two. (See table for director count.)

### 4. Adhere to a setting, genre, or both

Each genre has a <em class="req">highlighted feature</em>. Your video must include this feature.

Settings have no specific requirements. You’re free to choose any way to indicate the setting, the more obvious the better. This might include dialogue, costuming, set dressing, location, props, or anything else that strikes your fancy.

### 5. Adapt
You are free to modify the dialogue, action, and events of your chosen work in order to fit the style of your chosen genre, setting, and director(s).
For example, you might replace the weapons used in a duel for more setting-appropriate weapons or modify dialogue to fit a director’s style. The required content must remain recognizable, though.

### 6. Add a title card

Your video must begin with some kind of title card or text (physical or digital) containing the following information:

1. Team name
2. Team category & size (see table)
3. Chosen book
4. Chosen director(s)
5. Chosen settings and/or genres

### 7. Keep it to 5 minutes, max

### 8. Upload and submit

Upload your finished movie to YouTube, Google Drive, Dropbox, or some other public space on the internet, and send us the link. Visit the <a href=".">puzzle page</a> for the email address.

## Books, in detail

### The Adventures of Tom Sawyer

<div class="book-detail">
<div class="detail-pic book"><img src="{% puzz image_prefix|add:'images/books/tomsawyer.jpg' %}" alt="The Adventures of Tom Sawyer"></div>
<div class="detail">

Mark Twain’s first solo novel has been adapted plenty of times, but none have become classics. Maybe that’s because the actions of a tiny con artist who never really gets his comeuppance are not actually that endearing, but maybe it’s just because you haven’t tried it yet.

|Scene|Description|Required characters|Required content|
|--|--|--|--|
|Whitewashing and other cons|Chapter 2. Tom engages in an iconic con to get someone else to do his work.|Tom, Ben, and at least two other “victims” for Tom’s con.|Tom is doing a menial chore. Ben shows up. Tom pretends that doing the chore is desirable and manages to get Ben to “pay” Tom somehow to do the work. Tom repeats this con on at least two others.
|Courting Becky and other cons|Chapter 7. Tom puts the moves on Becky but trips himself up.|Tom, Becky|The dialogue from when Tom says “Now it’s all done, Becky” to when Becky says “then I ain’t the first you’ve ever been engaged to!”
|Faking one’s death and other cons|Chapter 17. Tom attends his own funeral rather than just telling people that he’s not dead.|Tom, Joe or Huck, at least three mourners.|An ongoing funeral for Tom plus Joe and/or Huck is interrupted by the supposed dead. The mourners are shocked but relieved.|

</div>
</div>

### The Count of Monte Cristo

Action! Adventure! Love! Revenge! This sprawling 117-chapter serial, rife with subplots and stories-within-stories and lengthy discussions of the author’s own dubious hobbies, has seen dozens of adaptations. Yours can’t possibly be the worst!

### The Fifth Season

Despite high popularity and a vast number of awards, Jemisin’s work has yet to be translated to the big screen. Remember, this is the first book of a trilogy, so be sure to draw the readers in. And be sure to contract a good special effects house for all the amazing fantastical elements and non-human characters. This sounds ideal for a low-budget indie picture!

Hoa tells Essun that they are not safe at Castrima. Essun replies with sarcasm.|

### Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus

Most people by this point know that Victor Frankenstein was the scientist rather than the creature that he creates. But this classic - considered by many to be the first true work of science fiction - is the subject of so many other misconceptions! The best way to dispel them is obviously an adaptation by an auteur director in a different genre and setting.

### The Great Gatsby

A very large fraction of American high school students have to read this book, making it - at least hypothetically - well known and beloved. None of the previous film adaptations have become truly iconic, so the field is open for you to leave your mark!

### The Little Prince

This modern classic, a balance of whimsy and insight, has been adapted into radio plays, movies, ballet, class projects, and more. But has anyone ever tried it your way? Well, probably yes, actually. But don't let that stop you!

### The Lord of the Flies

When you think of middle school, you naturally think of a situation that starts hopeful and friendly but quickly descends into betrayal and violence. This novel puts that all on a desert island rather than on campus. Where will you put it?

### A Memory Called Empire

Since the author is a historian who drew heavily from actual Byzantine politics, the plot should be easy enough to condense into a 90-minute movie. Especially all the flower symbolism and poetry. But mostly the politics.

### Pride and Prejudice

This Austen classic has already been adapted into some surprising settings, but that just means your own spin on it will find ready fans! NOTE: cannot be combined with the Regency Era England setting.

## Directors, in detail

You’ve managed to score a well-known director for your adaptation - or maybe two, for a collaboration that is sure to rake in the awards. Each director has decided to film in the style of one of their previous movies and will ensure that the two listed distinctive elements appear.

### Chantal Akerman

<div class="dir-detail">
<div class="detail-pic dir"><img src="{% puzz image_prefix|add:'images/directors/akerman.jpg' %}" alt="Chantal Akerman"></div>
<div class="detail">

<p class="styleof">In the style of Jeanne Dielman, 23 quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles</p>

**That’s the good part**: showing the mundane and ordinary parts of life will highlight the key moments of the story. Include at least one scene with no dialogue depicting ordinary parts of everyday life in real time (not a montage). You really want to let these scenes play out, so they should be at least 10 seconds long.

**Leave it alone**: a static camera that doesn't track the characters will add a special combination of tension and realism to our adaptation. Include at least one shot where the camera is stationary and the characters walk in and out of shot (fully or partially) while continuing the scene and engaging in consequential action or dialogue.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ih3nBxjkBH8" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The “Veal Cutlets” scene in <i>Jeanne Dielman, 23 quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles</i>. Akerman shows us a segment of the life of the main character, Jeanne Dielman. The scene is four and half minutes long and has no dialogue. A static camera position in Dielman’s kitchen is used throughout. Dielman often walks out of shot.

</div>
</div>

### Jackie Chan

<div class="dir-detail">
<div class="detail-pic dir"><img src="{% puzz image_prefix|add:'images/directors/Chan.jpg' %}" alt="Jackie Chan"></div>
<div class="detail">

<p class="styleof">In the style of Rumble in the Bronx</p>

**Anyone can do it**: all too often, action movies just show us heroes doing big stunts. To really make the audience believe in the hero’s skills, show them the little moments! Include at least one brief feat of manual dexterity or agility. For example, a juggling trick, some sleight of hand, or catching food in one’s mouth. Nothing big or dangerous, since that would defeat the purpose.

**Use what you have**: anyone can make a movie where people fight with swords and block with shields. What about a ladder fight or a refrigerator fight? Those are much more memorable! Include at least one moment when a character uses an everyday object (something not normally a weapon) for self defense or protection. This doesn’t need to be a full fight scene.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z1PCtIaM_GQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

A video essay on Jackie Chan’s style. His use of unusual objects during fights is covered at 1:20, while his perfectionism in executing small stunts flawlessly is covered at 3:35.

</div>
</div>

### Greta Gerwig

<div class="dir-detail">
<div class="detail-pic dir"><img src="{% puzz image_prefix|add:'images/directors/gerwig.jpg' %}" alt="Greta Gerwig"></div>
<div class="detail">

<p class="styleof">In the style of Lady Bird</p>

**Change it up**: Movie dialogue is normally focused on the scene and everyone knows just what to say. That’s not how people really talk, though. Real people get distracted, change topics suddenly, and shift emotion. Include at least one scene where characters abruptly change topic and tone.

**Cut in line**: People in movies usually take turns to talk, and might go on and on without ever being interrupted - even by their enemies. Real people butt in! Include at least one scene where characters repeatedly interrupt each other or talk over each other.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cNi_HC839Wo" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

A trailer for Lady Bird. The opening features characters talking over each other. Examples of sudden tone shifts in the middle of a conversation may be found throughout; the dialogue in the thrift store starting at 1:05 is a particularly strong case.

</div>
</div>

### Debra Granik

<div class="dir-detail">
<div class="detail-pic dir"><img src="{% puzz image_prefix|add:'images/directors/Granik.jpg' %}" alt="Debra Granik"></div>
<div class="detail">

<p class="styleof">In the style of Winter’s Bone</p>

**Let’s go outside**: wide, naturalistic outdoor shots have lots of uses: making the protagonist appear alone and vulnerable, making the protagonist appear small and an underdog, making the protagonist appear cold and uncomfortable, and more! Include at least one wide outdoor shot where you can see a long distance. Include characters - these aren’t just landscape shots!

**Carry that weight**: we need to drive home the main character’s struggle by showing their lasting pain and injuries. At least one character should have a very obvious, visible injury or wound which they are visibly dealing with. If the original work doesn’t have one, add a plausible one.

Ree seeks Merab’s help in Winter’s Bone. Ree is outside and cold throughout the scene, an effect further enhanced by Granik’s camera angles. The shot at 1:35 is a striking example. Ree will later suffer a beating at the hands of Merab. Ree sports the resulting bruises and wounds for the rest of the movie.

<div class="detail">


<p class="styleof">In the style of The Muppet Movie</p>

**Muppets are people, too**: Replace one of the required characters in each scene with a puppet of some kind. None of the other characters should acknowledge the fact that they’re speaking with a puppet, but should instead treat the puppet character like any other character.

**Muppets are funny**: In addition to the above, the puppet character must make a silly joke or bad pun of some kind in each scene and then ham it up for the camera.

A trailer for <i>The Muppet Movie</i>. The constant human and muppet character interactions go on without apparent comment or notice by said characters. The trailer ends with a joke made funny almost entirely by its blatant simplicity.

<div class="detail">

<p class="styleof">In the style of <i>Hana-bi</i></p>

**Deadpan everything**: sometimes not reacting makes a bigger statement than a display of strong emotion. Let’s bring that energy to our adaptation. Include at least one scene where a character has no visible emotional reaction to an event that would normally be expected to provoke a reaction (whether it be happiness, sadness, anger, etc).

**Cut to the aftermath**: letting the audience’s imagination fill in the gaps isn’t just for horror movies. Many scenes can be made more impactful - and cheaper! - by focusing on how characters react. Include at least one scene that starts at or cuts directly to the aftermath of an event and lingers on how the characters react.

The trailer for <i>Hana-bi</i>, which Kitano directed, wrote and starred in. Deadpan delivery and muted reactions are on display throughout, especially by Kitano himself. The trailer opens with two police officers reacting to a crime scene rather than showing the crime itself. Kitano cuts past or around moments of violence at 0:52 and 1:35, focusing instead on bystanders.

### Sergio Leone

<div class="detail">

<p class="styleof">In the style of The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly</p>

**Extreme close-ups:** the original characters need to be intense! Include multiple (at least three) extremely close-up shots of your characters that highlight their eyes.

**Hold it:** the original story has lots of room to build tension. The longer you hold a static shot, the more tension you build! Include at least one long-duration (at least 5 seconds) camera shot that has no dialogue or substantial action.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5PgAKzmWmuk" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The final showdown from The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly. Leone establishes the scene with a juxtaposition of very wide shots and close-up shots. He then escalates tension with faster and faster cuts and tighter and tighter close-ups. Characterization is done entirely through body language and facial expressions, especially the eyes.

### Lucrecia Martel

<div class="detail">

<p class="styleof">In the style of Zama</p>

**I heard that**: Diegetic sound is the absolute best and our adaptation needs it. Include at least one scene where sound that would normally be heard by the audience — but not the characters — actually occurs in-world, too.

**Look who’s talking**: Conventional films make sure the person speaking is always in view, most commonly by putting the speakers in the same shot or by using back and forth reversing shots. But real conversations are not nearly so objective and clinical! Include at least one scene where the camera consistently fails to show one of the participants in the conversation.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Dc5hiLqHa6g" title="YouTube clip" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The U.S. trailer for Zama. Diegetic sound is used throughout. Additionally, the line between diegetic and non-diegetic sound is frequently blurred. Spoken lines are frequently disassociated from the speaker. A simple example of the latter may be found at 0:35.

### Alan Smithee

<div class="detail-pic dir"><img src="{% puzz image_prefix|add:'images/directors/Smithee.jpg' %}" alt="Alan Smithee"></div>
<div class="detail">

<p class="styleof">In the style of the worst movie you’ve ever seen</p>

**Terrible cut**: cuts are an important part of the visual language of film, but why worry about that? Include at least one nonsensical cut that interrupts one scene’s dialogue or action straight into the middle of another’s.

**That was the best take**: you’ve only got so much time to shoot, and time is money! Include at least one scene with a blatant external interruption that clearly ruined the take.

A short documentary video on Alan Smithee, chronicling the rise and fall of this incredibly prolific and almost universally terrible “director.”

### Quentin Tarantino

<div class="detail">

<p class="styleof">In the style of Pulp Fiction.</p>

**Gratuitous profanity**: the original dialogue clearly needs to be spiced up! Laden it profusely with profanity. Or, if you prefer, make it a TV edit. You can censor the profanity back out, “overdub” it with highly implausible mouth-movement matches, or anything else to get it cleaned up to a TV-PG language standard.

**Shoot the shot**: the original needs some action and a good surprise twist. Specifically, someone needs to get shot unexpectedly or with unexpected results (such as an explosion of gore or a ridiculous wire pull or other stunt that sends someone flying).

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CvMwk_3a918?start=55" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

A fan edit of the “Ezekiel 25:17” scene from Pulp Fiction. Representative dialogue with fan-added censoring ramps up at the 1:00 mark. Also, someone gets shot with some unusual cuts. If you are familiar with the movie, you will be aware of several other shootings that are a great deal more over-the-top.

## Settings, in detail

A new and exciting adaptation needs a new and unexpected setting. Which is to say, a different setting than the work’s default setting. Your choice of setting should be clearly established with some combination of set and stage dressing, location, and costuming.

### Feudal-ish somewhere!

Set your adaptation in a world of swords and armor, honor and duty, horses and heraldry (or nifty logos of some kind), and maybe kingdom in peril - be it western Europe, eastern Asia, or beyond.

### In Space!

Whether hard or soft science fiction, move your adaptation into the stars.

### In the 80s!

Whether you go for big hair and giant shoulder pads, pop-nostalgia TV, or just really like the cold war as a backdrop, it’s time to set the Delorean to 1985 (plus or minus 5).

### On the high seas!

Move your adaptation to the age of sail. Pirates, cannons, secret islands, or good old scurvy - what will await?

### Regency-era England!

It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a book seeking a good adaptation, must be in want of an empire waistline.

### Steampunk!

Upgrade the recent past with implausible clockwork technology, superfluous goggles, questionable prosthetics, a dash of dystopia, and ideally some zeppelins.

### Swords and sandals!

Go back to the golden age of Hollywood with a Classical-era adaptation. Ancient Rome is the most obvious, but any other roughly contemporaneous mediterranean society will be fine. Just be really obvious about it.

### Swords and sorcery!

Add a bit of fantasy and magic - or a lot - to make your adaptation sing. NOTE: singing is strongly encouraged.


## Genres, in detail

What sort of adaptation are we making? Well, there’s no sense in just making a movie. You have to consider what audience you’re appealing to - your target demographic. What genre will really get the ticket sales going?

### Adventures with zombies

Braaaaains! Adventure stories need a clear, strong motivation, and there’s nothing quite like zombies to bring an immediate sense of menace and impending doom. Plus the costumes and makeup are easy and awesome! Anyway, include <em class="req">at least one person costumed as a zombie</em>. Braaaaains!

### Award season character drama

Let’s get that statue! Wring as much tragedy and drama out of your adaptation as possible. In other words, <em class="req">somebody needs to cry at some point</em>. Critics hate being happy!

### Big budget summer blockbuster action movie

Let’s go commercial! Your adaptation needs to include <em class="req">at least one special effects shot (visual effects or practical effects)</em>. Bada-boom!

### Feel-good sports drama

People like sports, so naturally people like movies about sports! Include <em class="req">at least one depiction of a sport being played by the characters</em>. Score!

### For kids

Let’s appeal to that lucrative child market! By which we mean: let’s sell things to kids. Include <em class="req">at least one blatant product placement</em> for a real or imagined product. Educational!

### Fun but serious musical

Everyone loves a song! Your adaptation needs to include <em class="req">at least one original song establishing characterization or explaining plot</em>. Broadway awaits!

### Spy thriller

Let’s capitalize on anxieties! Give your adaptation that cool, gritty feel. You can do this with scriptwriting, but mostly you just need filters. Include <em class="req">at least one scene with heavy blue tinting throughout</em>. Intriguing!

### Throwback tribute movie

Nostalgia sells! Give your adaptation the feel of a classic by making it the way they used to. That is, a movie rather than a talkie. Include at least <em class="req">one scene with dialogue cards (physical or digital) rather than audible spoken dialogue</em>!
