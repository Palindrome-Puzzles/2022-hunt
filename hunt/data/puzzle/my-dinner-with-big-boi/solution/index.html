<p>The video is a conversation between two characters. Each of their lines clues a well-known movie. Upon further inspection, we realize that each of these movies was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture. There are 28 years represented, each with 4 (of 5 nominees) clued in the dialogue. That gets us to all 112 (28 * 4) lines.</p>

<p>In 28 of the shots, the sign in the background shows a number. After mapping lines to movies and years, we can determine that each number is associated with a different year.</p>

	<p>The video features Sandy's 10-year-old daughter Zella in both parts.</p>

	<p>The title (and the video) is a play on the singularly idiosyncratic dinner party movie <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Dinner_with_Andre">My Dinner With Andre</a>,  but swapping out Andre for Big Boi — Andre (3000) and Big Boi being the members of the duo in the band Outkast. That was where the joke was meant to end, but in our testing we discovered an accidental deeper meaning: in this puzzle you are finding all but one member of a set, and then indexing into the remaining member. In other words, the <i>outcast</i>. Sometimes the puzzle gods just smile on you.

	<p>The instructions about making a movie were written by April and Eric Pinnick.</p>
