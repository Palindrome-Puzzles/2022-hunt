<ul class="copy-only">
<li>Person 1: I've decided to have surgery in London.</li>
<li>Person 2: Don't forget to change trains in Paris!</li>
<li>Person 1: You're a silly lass.</li>
<li>Person 2: I'm just a fan of interconnectivity.</li>
<li>Person 1: I know what you mean. Once it took me almost THREE MONTHS to travel the globe.</li>
<li>Person 2: That's not unusual, pussycat.</li>
<li>Person 1: You always say the correct things.</li>
<li>Person 2: What can I say, I've got a really pretty brain.</li>
<li>Person 1: Reminds me of the time I found myself on an unexpected vacation.</li>
<li>Person 2: Where were you on vacation, The Colosseum?</li>
<li>Person 1: No, it was a city in North Dakota.</li>
<li>Person 2: USA! USA!</li>
<li>Person 1: And I on my way to catch a plane…</li>
<li>Person 2: … USA! so lovely…</li>
<li>Person 1: And my Lyft chauffeur said —</li>
<li>Person 2: Oh! Was it… &quot;Don't crush your hand in the apple machine!&quot;?</li>
<li>Person 1: No, he said &quot;The Soviets are on their way! Don't make me say it again.&quot;</li>
<li>Person 2: Sounds like a really decent guy.</li>
<li>Person 1: Well, he was from Jersey.</li>
<li>Person 2: Not a city in Bavaria?</li>
<li>Person 1: Anyway, right then, a bit of sunlight hits me.</li>
<li>Person 2: Like a state on fire.</li>
<li>Person 1: … and all of a sudden — <em>BANG</em> — we hit another car.</li>
<li>Person 2: Sounds like a bumpy ride.</li>
<li>Person 1: It was inexcusable, and I'll never let it go.</li>
<li>Person 2: You deserve reparation.</li>
<li>Person 1: The guy drove like a Roman dictator.</li>
<li>Person 2: Or like Gordon Shumway, that is.</li>
<li>Person 1: Then he leapt out and screamed, &quot;Sweet dreams and I hope you don't die!&quot;</li>
<li>Person 2: Did anyone see this happen?</li>
<li>Person 1: Just this one-man band.</li>
<li>Person 2: Just like Julia and Eric's dad!</li>
<li>Person 1: Yeah, I loved his bebop, big band, fusion, …</li>
<li>Person 2: The dude could drizzle.</li>
<li>Person 1: After that, I walked to The Red Mill.</li>
<li>Person 2: Isn't that the shop where I got my ink of Axl?</li>
<li>Person 1: No that was called The Queen of the Nile.</li>
<li>Person 2: Or was it Queen of the Gods?</li>
<li>Person 1: No, THAT place was owned by McFly.</li>
<li>Person 2: What was his first name, Truman?</li>
<li>Person 1: No, I think it was Bandito.</li>
<li>Person 2: Sounds like a really perilous connection.</li>
<li>Person 1: I'll tell you this: he was a very rich child.</li>
<li>Person 2: I wouldn't want to compete with him to see who could produce the most tears.</li>
<li>Person 1: Whether it's pepper, cayenne, oregano… that's your guy.</li>
<li>Person 2: Yikes, spicy stuff makes me turn red and blue.</li>
<li>Person 1: Really? It makes me speak lots of different languages.</li>
<li>Person 2: When was this, June 21st?</li>
<li>Person 1: Yes, and it was a really warm evening. Like really warm.</li>
<li>Person 2: Oh yeah, right after cold front hit the whole country.</li>
<li>Person 1: So, then, I found a pilot…</li>
<li>Person 2: Did you write 手紙 to Sulfur Island?</li>
<li>Person 1: I couldn't understand that.</li>
<li>Person 2: Sorry, I just recently got my degree and was showing off. Go on.</li>
<li>Person 1: It was tough to get her away from her tangoing with Geri and Freki.</li>
<li>Person 2: Those are the ones who looted the missing boat!</li>
<li>Person 1: I know, it's the kind of thing that makes you want to murder a passerine.</li>
<li>Person 2: I'm sobbing and murmuring just thinking about it.</li>
<li>Person 1: (to waiter) Hey! Mr. Stone!</li>
<li>Person 2: Oh, you'll never believe who's joining us to eat.</li>
<li>Person 1: (to waiter) Avez-vous ma saveur préférée de crème glacée?</li>
<li>Person 2: She fights wild animals in front of a crowd.</li>
<li>Person 1: (to waiter) … and make it HUGE.</li>
<li>Person 2: And she has this lovely aroma.</li>
<li>Person 1: Merci. (Turns back) Everything here tastes like hardtack.</li>
<li>Person 2: Try pureeing it.</li>
<li>Person 1: I give this place a D.</li>
<li>Person 2: I can't decide between ordering a Cosmo… or a different Cosmo.</li>
<li>Person 1: I got the Gwen's Smooch. It stung.</li>
<li>Person 2: What's in that? Honey, pumpkin, sugarplum?</li>
<li>Person 1: Just spit and polish.</li>
<li>Person 2: Get back to your story, this is why I rise up from bed every day.</li>
<li>Person 1: I should've come over to where you sleep and told the story there.</li>
<li>Person 2: Only if you could evict the demons first.</li>
<li>Person 1: Hmm. So, I rode over the spooky creek.</li>
<li>Person 2: Did you see any spectres?!</li>
<li>Person 1: No, but the going was slow, there were lots of cars on the road.</li>
<li>Person 2: Don't hit another car, you'll cut yourself and need a lot of bandages.</li>
<li>Person 1: Especially if we're hit laterally.</li>
<li>Person 2: … and you'll need more clothes. From your armoire.</li>
<li>Person 1: We passed Hobbes and Puff, though we could barely see them.</li>
<li>Person 2: You'll never see those two, even if you start now and go forever.</li>
<li>Person 1: And then we saw several horse-drawn vehicles, aflame!</li>
<li>Person 2: Pour some out for those who've left us.</li>
<li>Person 1: Finally we were able to separate ourselves from the pack.</li>
<li>Person 2: Just like my favorite Cincinnati team.</li>
<li>Person 1: And the pilot throws off their cloak to reveal themselves to be —</li>
<li>Person 2: … Elizabeth II?</li>
<li>Person 1: No no, she's so busy boxing with that member of Parliament and all of her friends.</li>
<li>Person 2: Was it Barry Sanders covered in snow?</li>
<li>Person 1: Nope. Last I heard he was trading a Wachowski movie for a Zwick.</li>
<li>Person 2: My beloved and a ghost?</li>
<li>Person 1: No! It was Charlie Daniels, dressed up as Santa!</li>
<li>Person 2: That's no easy task!</li>
<li>Person 1: Thank god it wasn't Elvis. We'd make a weird pair.</li>
<li>Person 2: No weirder than Nickleby and Lady Ogilvy II.</li>
<li>Person 1: You can say that again… or write that on two stone tablets.</li>
<li>Person 2: This pilot was great at steering the plane, giving orders, and taking people to antipodes.</li>
<li>Person 1: Yep, and then we went over 5000 energy-efficient feet up in the air.</li>
<li>Person 2: Did you see spray paint across the country?</li>
<li>Person 1: Only some tigers and stargazers in the meadow.</li>
<li>Person 2: Clattering like little rocks on the beach.</li>
<li>Person 1: Uncovering mysteries and untruths.</li>
<li>Person 2: With no risk of a rebellion about the prize money.</li>
<li>Person 1: We landed in Ethiopia, but then we left.</li>
<li>Person 2: Is that where grandfathers aren't allowed?</li>
<li>Person 1: Not really, there are a handful of simple steps to avoid that.</li>
<li>Person 2: One of them is to not anger a bee.</li>
<li>Person 1: Sounds like a recipe for immediate world annihilation.</li>
<li>Person 2: You know, we should leave if we're gonna hit the final screening tonight.</li>
<li>Person 1: Oh yeah, my source told me it's a good one. What's it about?</li>
<li>Person 2: It's about 3 after and 5 before what we've been talking about this whole time.</li>
