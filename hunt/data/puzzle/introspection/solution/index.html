<p>Every task that's completed reveals more and more of the introspection message. The message is programmatically generated, and is different for each team solving the puzzle (for reasons described below). As tasks are completed, characters are revealed in order of increasing frequency, and if a team has accomplished all 13 tasks, spaces are added to the message as well.</p>
<p>Most of the message is an alphabetically sorted sequence of items, each taken from a different canonical list of items. The number of the item within its list is between 1 and 26 inclusive, and therefore corresponds to a letter. For example the message might include <span class="monospace">IRON MAN</span>, the first MCU movie, which corresponds with <span class="monospace">A</span>; or <span class="monospace">THE ENEMY WITHIN</span>, the fifth Star Trek episode, which corresponds with <span class="monospace">E</span>.</p>
<p>Since the items are alphabetical within the message, it makes sense to reorder them. Each of the lists of items can be associated with one of the numbered tasks, which provides an ordering.</p>

<p>The result is still encoded, differently for each team. For example, team Palindrome's message would be <span class="monospace">BOCIYHTCYTPSD</span>. The last part of the message, after the list items, are the words "<span class="monospace">AND NOW VIGENERE</span>". The Vigenère cipher can decode the result, but what key to use? As the flavor text indicates, <i>you are the key</i>. Each team must use its own username for the hunt site as its Vigenère key. Thus:<p>
