<p>As hinted in the flavortext, some of the blooms can lose their "heads" (first letters) to give 5-letter answers that still fit their clues. From top to bottom in the grid, they are:</p>
<table>
<tr><td>Covered with grease, say</td><td>(S)OILED</td></tr>
<tr><td>Rings</td><td>(A)TOLLS</td></tr>
<tr><td>Freight transporter, sometimes</td><td>(D)RIVER</td></tr>
<tr><td>They're shunned by the pious</td><td>(D)EVILS</td></tr>
<tr><td>Acquires through effort</td><td>(L)EARNS</td></tr>
<tr><td>Supplies a fitting line</td><td>(E)QUIPS</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The beheaded letters spell out SADDLE; applying the beheading one more time gives <span class="answer">ADDLE</span>, a word that matches the flavortext (vis-à-vis the effect of the poppies on you), so that is the answer to the puzzle.</p>

	<h2>Author's Note</h2>

	<p>It's nice to get an opportunity to use skills from your day job to make a hunt puzzle. of course, you might consider it cheating since my day job is … making Rows Garden puzzles (of which this is an example). This variety crossword type was invented by Patrick Berry in the mid-2000s, and it's now a staple of both the crossword landscape and the Mystery Hunt. Although I've now constructed well over 300 "regular" Rows Gardens that don't have any meta extraction, the very first one I ever made did, the Rose Kennedy puzzle for BAPHL 7 back in 2013. A year later, I tried making another one, and then another, and the year after that, I quit teaching and made Rows Gardens my job. Sometimes making a puzzle can change your life!</p>

	<p>Spoilers for Once Upon a Time in the Quest:
	<span class="spoiler">The three most unusual features of the grid are its nonstandard size/shape, and the entries for Row B1 (SMOKEY THE BEAR, when officially he is and always has been SMOKEY BEAR) and Row N1 (CLIMATIC REGION, a phrase that probably falls short of dictionary nature). These were all the result of the extra constraint forced on the grid by the extra hidden answer. I tried pretty hard to make it all work in a standard (21x12) grid, with only frustration to show for it. But as soon as I gave the grid some room to breathe by changing the dimensions, it came together beautifully.</span>
