These spaces contain the letters of the word LOVE.  Those letters use a font different from any of the other letters in the grid.\r\n4) LOVE is also the last word in the list beside the grid.\r\n5) The font used for the 16 4-letter words matches the font of the letters in the red spaces.\r\n6) There is a box or bordered area at the top, labeled START.  Two of the 16 4-letter words -- FOUR and DICE -- are in this box.
