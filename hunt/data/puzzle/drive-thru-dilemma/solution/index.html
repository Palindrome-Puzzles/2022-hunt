<p>Solvers are presented with a set of ten audio files, encoded with a mixture of beeping and words depending on the audio file.  Some of these encodings are easy to identify, while others are trickier.  </p>

<p>The encodings are as follows:</p>

<table>
<tr><td>File</td>
<td>Encoding</td></tr>
<tr><td>a</td>
<td>morse</td></tr>
<tr><td>b</td>
<td>semaphore (flag directions)</td></tr>
<tr><td>c</td>
<td>bacon</td></tr>
<tr><td>d</td>
<td>Pig latin</td></tr>
<tr><td>e</td>
<td>tap code</td></tr>
<tr><td>f</td>
<td>DTMF/phone speak</td></tr>
<tr><td>g</td>
<td>audio spectrograph</td></tr>
<tr><td>h</td>
<td>UbbiDubbi</td></tr>
<tr><td>i</td>
<td>phonetic alphabet</td></tr>
<tr><td>j</td>
<td>braille spoken (123456)</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Each of the sentences, once decoded, is a Harvard sentence (<a href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~hgs/audio/harvard.html">http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~hgs/audio/harvard.html</a>) with one word altered.  Harvard sentences, sometimes called Harvard lines, are a collection of sample phrases that are used for standardized testing of Voice over IP, cellular, and other telephone systems. They are phonetically balanced sentences that use specific phonemes at the same frequency they appear in English.</p>

<p>Each audio file is a sentence from one of the first ten sets of sentences.  In each case, the word that is replaced is the one that matches the sentence number.</p>
