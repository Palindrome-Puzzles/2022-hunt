<p>The first step is to solve the list of clues, which each give an answer phrase matching the given enumeration.</p>

<p>The puzzle title is the last book from the Percy Jackson & The Olympians (PJO) pentalogy by Rick Riordan, and clues Olympian gods for the first aha. Each of these phrases contain a word that is one of the domain/patron areas of an <a href="https://riordan.fandom.com/wiki/Olympians" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">Olympian from the PJO universe</a> (which includes some minor Olympians beyond the standard ones, following the events of the book).</p>

<p>The phrases in the flavortext "Camp Half-Blood" and "cabin fever" hints that the Greek versions of these Olympians should be used (as opposed to the Roman versions which are also in the series, but would apply to the counterpart Camp Jupiter) and the list of Olympians are also patrons to <a href="https://riordan.fandom.com/wiki/Cabins" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">numbered cabins in Camp Half-blood</a>.</p>

<p>The next step is to use the cabin number of the Olympian to index into the corresponding answer phrase to extract a letter each. The answer phrases, domain areas, Greek Olympians, and indexed letters are summarized in the table below.</p>

<p>Extracting the numbered letters gives WEIGHTED NET, another thing that appeared  in the PJO universe, and which could be similarly paired with the last character  Annabeth.
