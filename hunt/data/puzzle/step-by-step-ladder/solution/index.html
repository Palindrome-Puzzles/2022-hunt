<p>The puzzle consists of definitions to words that can make 3 separate word ladders -- the definitions have been put into a single set and alphabetized.</p>
<p>The longest ladder is missing 4 rungs -- those rungs are the four 4-letter answers to this puzzle. The other two ladders are complete, and their letter changes form two 7-letter words, which are the remaining two answers to this puzzle.</p>
