<p>Solvers are presented with a set of images of a goblin and Reepicheep fighting with swords (in fact, they are rapiers, which is Reepicheep's favourite weapon, and perfect for duelling!). The goblin is speaking in emojis and Reepicheep appears to be responding in formal sounding words.</p>

<p>Looking at the images combined with the flavor text ("monkeying around") should point solvers to <a href="https://monkeyisland.fandom.com/wiki/Insult_Sword_Fighting" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">Monkey Island insult sword fighting</a>.</p>

<p>The goblin's insults can be translated as follows:</p>

<p>Reepicheep's comebacks are provided in alphabetic order (based on the formal speech he is using). Once translated back to the original Monkey Island insult swordfighting comebacks, they can then be matched to the goblin's insult.</p>

<p>Now that the insults and comebacks are matched, the swords become important. The matched insult and comeback pair form a semaphore letter. </p>

<p>For example, with the first insult (This is the END for you, you gutter crawling cur!) the sword is pointing up and right (North East). In the response (I provide you with a pointed SUGGESTION, understand the BARB?/And I've got a little TIP for you, get the POINT?), Reepicheep's sword points due East. This gives a W.</p>
