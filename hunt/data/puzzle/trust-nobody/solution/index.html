That is, the English word is also a Dutch word, but it means something different than the English word.

<p>The flag fingerprint in the corner of the screen for each question corresponds to a country that was a filming location for a season of the Dutch reality show &ldquo;Wie Is De Mol?&rdquo;. Some seasons filmed in multiple countries; in those cases, the flag is of the last country visited in that season.</p>

<p>The flags are in season order from season 5 to season 20. Reordering the questions by putting the correct answers in alphabetical order (as suggested by the first letters of the wrong answers) makes the green letters spell <span class="monospace">NAMEN VAN DE MOLLEN</span>, which is Dutch for &ldquo;names of the Moles&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Determine the name of the Mole from each of those seasons, then index into the names using the numbers of euros added to the pot, which spells <span class="answer">FRIENDLY REMINDER</span>.</p>
