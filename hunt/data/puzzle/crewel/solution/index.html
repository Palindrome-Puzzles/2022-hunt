<p>This puzzle begins with 24 nonsensical sentences. Upon closer inspection, solvers will realize that each sentence is actually multiple crossword clues, interwoven together. Most are 2 clues long, some are 3, and one is 4 clues. All the clues are in order, so the sentences need only to be pulled apart correctly to see the proper clues.</p>

<p>As solvers work through the clues, they discover that each answer has the same number of letters as its clue has words. For instance, the 3-word “stack the deck” leads to the 3-letter RIG. After all the clues of a sentence have been solved, teams must then reweave the letters of their answers in the same order that they originally appeared (The book <em>Crewel</em> is about a girl who can reweave reality, and crewel is also a type of embroidery using wool.). Doing so reveals that each sentence is in fact a world capital, minus one letter. As an example:</p>

<p>Dance young style originally strapping from Brazil boy</p>

<p>Breaks down into:</p>
<p>Dance style originally from Brazil: SAMBA<br>
Young strapping boy: LAD</p>

<p>Which <em>reweaves</em> into SLAMABAD, which is one I away from the capital of Pakistan, ISLAMABAD.</p>

<p>Taking the missing letters, in order, spells out the instruction INTERWEAVE GOLF SOUK PESTLE. Applying the same logic to the words GOLF SOUK PESTLE, teams discover the correct answer, <span class="answer">GOSPEL OF ST LUKE.</span></p>

<p>A full solution for each clue is included below.

  <h2>Author's Note</h2>
  <p>Fun facts about making this puzzle:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The original inspiration was from the realization that DUSHANBE, the capital of Tajikistan, could be broken up into DUB and SHANE. Ironically, DUSHANBE was only added towards the end, when the answer changed from GOSPEL OF LUKE.</li>
		<li>By far, the hardest letter to find a capital/clue set for was F. Go ahead, try for yourself.</li>
		<li>This puzzle (and its constructor) nearly had a full breakdown in testing when I had a perfect set for BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN, only for one of my testers to realize I had misspelled it as BANDAR SERI BAGAWAN.</li>
	</ul>
<p>My goal was, as <em>[title of show]</em> puts it, to be 9 people’s favorite thing, instead of 100 people’s 9th-favorite thing. If you’re one of my 9, thank you so much!</p>
