<p>The coded text below the video spells out various lyrics from the Eurovision pastiche "Love Love Peace Peace" (see author's note below) with ❤️ for consonants and ☮️ for vowels. "Love Love Peace Peace" is a pastiche of various Eurovision performance elements, each of which can be linked with one of the full performances from the clips in the video.</p>
<p>Watching LLPP and the original performances of these songs can be used to link an element with its song</p>

<div class="author-note">
  <h2>Author's Note</h2>
  <p>I've wanted to write a pure Eurovision puzzle for Hunt for Y E A R S.  It's a 65-year dataset with plenty of angles for puzzle-writing.</p>
  <p>Once we decided that we wanted teams to write Eurovision pastiches as part of the Self-Help tasks, I <em>knew</em> I wanted to make sure teams had seen "Love Love Peace Peace" so they knew what that should look like:</p>

  <p>Once that was the starting point, the rest of the puzzle came together quickly, pulling in as many of the songs LLPP references as I could.</p>
