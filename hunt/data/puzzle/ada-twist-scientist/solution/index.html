<p>As suggested by the rest of the poem, solvers should think “initially” about these two word phrases, and consider whether each bigram can be:</p>
<ul><li>an abbreviation for a US state (“Where are they from?”, “Ada studied the places throughout her homeland”)</li>
<li>a chemical element (“What are things made of?”, “Or examined the nature of things near at hand”)</li>
<li>both (“Sometimes she learned one thing; sometimes she learned two.”)</li>
<li>or neither (“Some times she learned nothing: well what can you do?”)</li></ul>

<p>Also pulling from the poem, solvers should consider these counts in groups of threes
(“just three at the time”, “She looked at, in turn, e'ry”) to interpret these as ternary values and get the final answer: <span class="answer">UPCYCLE</span>.</p>
