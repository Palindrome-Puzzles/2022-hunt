<p>On each page of the jukebox, all of the song clips are "What's New, Pussycat?" by Tom Jones, except for one, which is a clip from a Salt-N-Pepa song, followed by a series of "whoa"s (from "What's New, Pussycat?"), the last of which is longer than the others.</p>
<p>The initial letters of the songs that play "What's New, Pussycat?" spell out DON'T NEED THESE SONGS OR ARTISTS OR JOHN MULANEY'S ROUTINE TO SOLVE WHOA WHOA WHOA, as an additional hint that the songs that play the Salt-N-Pepa clips are the only important ones.</p>

<p class="blank-words">Each of these words is one half of a common "<span class="blank-word"></span> and <span class="blank-word"></span>" phrase, just like our featured artist. First, determine the companion word in each phrase. (As a confirmer, the length of each page's companion word is the same as the number of tracks on that page. For example, page A has 5 tracks, and the companion word is ASKED, which has 5 letters.) Then use the numerical position of the Salt-N-Pepa clip on the page as an index into that word.</p>

<p class="blank-words">Each of the "<span class="blank-word"></span> and <span class="blank-word"></span>" phrases is thematically related to one of the displayed songs that contains a Salt-N-Pepa clip. Beginning with "asked and answered" (the phrase derived from the clip on jukebox page A), take the indexed letter, then connect the song title that played the Salt-N-Pepa clip to the related phrase on another jukebox page. When the chain is connected correctly, the indexed letters will spell KETCHUP N WHAT, which leads to the answer <span class="answer">MUSTARD</span>.</p>

    <h2>Authors' Notes</h2>

	<p>First of all, if you haven't heard John Mulaney's Salt and Pepper Diner routine, please set aside the next six minutes and fourteen seconds, and enjoy:</p>

	<p><b>From Sandy:</b></p>

	<p>The Mulaney bit, and trolling with "What's New, Pussycat?", is a favorite pastime in our house, and got me wanting to do the same with a puzzle in the hunt. The first pitch was:</p>

	<p>Fortunately, we quickly moved from that and eventually found this lovely balance of Salt-N-Pepa and Tom Jones.</p>

	<p><b>From Ben:</b></p>

	<p>Can you believe that John Mulaney <em>also</em> has a joke about Salt N Pepa?  I forgot about this recent monologue bit until a week before the Hunt.</p>
