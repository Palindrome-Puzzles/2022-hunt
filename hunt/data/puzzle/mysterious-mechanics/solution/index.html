<p>This puzzle makes use of the "The Physical World" relief on the north-northwest wall of the Eastman Lobby (Lobby 6) at MIT.</p>
<p>Various pictures appear online and a couple are Googleable, including <a href="https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/6-120-2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">this one on the MIT Admissions website</a>, and (harder to find at first, but giving better detail) <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:The_Physical_World_Plaque_in_MIT_Building_6.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">this one on Wikimedia Commons.</a></p>
<p>Specifically:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Each "Attempt Number" clues one of the words in the text at the bottom; this enables us to order the rows by the order of these words in the text.</li><br>
	<li>Each "Attempted Repair" involves connecting what sound like two auto parts. These are actually references to two parts of the picture in the relief.<br><br>Drawing a line from the first part to the second and continuing gets you to one of the eleven pictures of scientists around the edge; the scientist's name has one phoneme in common with the onomatopoetic word used to describe the engine sound.</li>
</ol>

<p>The resulting chart summarizes what 1 and 2 give us:</p>

<p>Taking these phonemes in order gives LAST HUPP CARS (hinted in the intro; they are vintage automobiles).<br>
The answer is thus the last cars made by the Hupp Motor Car Company: <span class="answer">SKYLARKS</span> (hinted in the flavortext; "capers" and "skylarks" are synonymous verbs).</p>
