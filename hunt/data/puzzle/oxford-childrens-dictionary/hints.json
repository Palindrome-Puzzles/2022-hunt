[[0.0, ["Getting started"], "One word from the word bank at the bottom fills in one of the blanks in the clues above to give a definition (except for the 2 clues with multiple blanks at the bottom -- that's the endgame)."], [10.0, ["Still having trouble getting started"], "The clues in the left column lead pretty straightforward to single-word answers. The clues on the right side lead to the same answer words, but \"wackily\" construed (using a pun or other wordplay, as though someone heard the word spoken and construed what they heard in a rather unlikely way)."], [20.0, ["What happens after finding the words?"], "Each word in the word bank has a number associated with it. Use that number to extract a letter from the answer word that goes with the completed clue -- each answer word will be used once on the left and once on the right. Always index into the actual answer word, not the \"punny\" version of it (which is not what would appear in the dictionary)."], [100.0, ["extraction"], "The extracted letters yield words on the left side and words on the right side. Put those words into the clues with blanks at the bottom, and that will give one last word, clued straightforwardly on the left and wackily on the right. That word is the answer to the puzzle."]]
