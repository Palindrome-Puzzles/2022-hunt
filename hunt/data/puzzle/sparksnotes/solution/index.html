<h2>The Album Covers</h2>
<p>Each album cover is a collage of elements from the cover of one of the twenty-six studio albums released by the band Sparks as of January 2022. Assigning the letters A-Z to those albums in chronological order, the image corresponding to each letter is identifiable using the guide below:</p>
<a href="images/0.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/0.png" width=1000 alt="Sparks album to collage chart"></a>
<p>V is unused in the puzzle.</p>

<p>Parsing each image as a collection of letters, we get the following values:</p>
<table class="grid crossword">
<tr><td>AGIIIILLMORU</td><td>IIIIORRSSSSS</td><td>ACEEHIKLLU</td></tr>
<tr><td>ADEEFIILNNRRSS</td><td>AABCCEEHHIIILLLLOOOPQTTTTUUZZ</td><td>AAAAHKKKORSTT</td></tr>
<tr><td>AAAEEEEHILLOPRST</td><td>AABEHNORSTY</td><td>AHIJNNNOSSUWY</td></tr>
<tr><td>AEIIIKMNNOPRRSSST</td><td>AABEEEHIJLNORTZ</td><td>AABCEIILNN</td></tr>
<tr><td>AAACCEEEGHLLLMRSWWX</td><td>BDEEHJOT</td><td>EEHILMRUUYY</td></tr>
</table>

<p>We'll come back to these in a second.</p>

<p>Read in clue order, the extra letters spell out INDEX WORD NUMBERS WITHIN EACH LINE.</p>
<p>Each clue has the same number of words as the character's name.  Taking the position of "Ron" and "Russell" in each set of clues and extracting the letters in the same position of the names of the characters, this gives a new set of bigrams.  Putting these bigrams in order by album cover spells out:</p>
<table class="grid crossword">
<tr><td>RU</td><td>SS</td><td>EL</td></tr>
<tr><td>LS</td><td>QU</td><td>AR</td></tr>
<tr><td>ES</td><td>TA</td><td>NO</td></tr>
<tr><td>RT</td><td>HN</td><td>EI</td></tr>
<tr><td>GH</td><td>BO</td><td>UR</td></tr>

<p>The UK spelling of "neighbour" suggests we want the London Underground. Tracing along the Piccadilly Line northward from Russell Square, the next station along the line is <span class="answer">KINGS CROSS ST PANCRAS.</span></p>

    <h2>Author's Notes</h2>
    <p>While on a writing retreat for Hunt, Shai mentioned he had just seen Edgar Wright's documentary about Sparks, <em>The Sparks Brothers</em>, and I jokingly suggested you could have an audio puzzle based on whether Ron Mael's mustache at the time was a short little Chaplin mustache or a pencil-thin mustache.</p>
    <p>That likely wouldn't have worked, but then we realized that with the release of the soundtrack of their musical film <em>Annette</em>, there were 26 Sparks studio albums.  26 is a nice number for encoding things, and we were off to the races.</p>
