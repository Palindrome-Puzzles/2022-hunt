<p>Each of the 26 cards clues the elements of a pangram that can be assembled from the word bank.</p>

<p>Checking the letter counts of each pangram against the letter counts of the card, there is one extra letter on each card.</p>

<p>Each pangram starts with a different letter of the alphabet, suggesting that these should be placed in alphabetical order once assembled.  The extra letter from each card, in alphabetical order, spells out FIRST WORD DIRTY LAST WORD MOPS, giving the final answer for the puzzle, <span class="answer">DIRTY MOPS</span>.</p>

    <h2>Author's Notes</h2>
    <p>Justin had the idea of doing something as all-inclusive as possible with pangrams, and the thought of doing something that repeatedly used A-Z in as many elements as possible appealed to me as well.  After going a little <em>too</em> high-concept and trying to do something riffing on SNL's Stefon (this phrase has <em>EVERYTHING</em>, etc.), thinking about the theme of this round made me think of the page in Ikea instruction manuals listing out every screw and fastener you should have received in your flat-pack kit, and here we are.</p>
    <p>MASSIVE thanks to Craig Eliason's <a href="https://dailypangram.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">The Daily Pangram blog</a> (which you may have discovered while solving this puzzle) for helping us figure out a clueable pangram that starts with every letter of the alphabet.</p>
