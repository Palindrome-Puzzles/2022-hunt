<p>This puzzle comprises 8 mini-puzzles based on the Death Matches/Main Matches in the Korean reality television 
    game show series “The Genius” (clued by the flavortext). Solving each mini-puzzle yields a 7-letter answer, 
    and is akin to earning a “garnet”, which is a cubic in-game reward currency. A final mini-meta puzzle then 
    uses the answers (garnets) from the 8 mini-puzzles. </p>
<p>The Death Matches/Main Matches referenced need to be identified from the series, and are mostly inspired by 
    familiar logic or strategy games. Information about their rules are available on “The Genius” 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Genius_(TV_series)">Wikipedia</a> and 
    <a href="https://the-genius.fandom.com/wiki/The_Genius_Game_Wikia">Fandom</a> pages, with detailed recaps on 
    <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheGenius">TV Tropes</a>, as well as other standalone 
    write-ups by various fans. The list of mini-puzzles are given in alphabetical order of the names of the Death 
    Matches/Main Matches to aid identification. </p>

<h2>Mini-puzzle 1 - 5:5 Game (by Celestine Lau)</h2>
<p>This is a Main Match where the players had to pose yes/no questions to a group of 10 guests, with the goal 
    being to obtain exactly 5 “yes” and 5 “no” answers. In this puzzle, the questions are provided, with the 
    goal being to find the group of 10 uppercase letters which can provide 5 “yes” and 5 “no” answers to the 
    given questions.</p>
<p>This puzzle can be approached in several ways. Solvers should first list down which of the 26 letters satisfy 
    the given criteria. The question “Is it always a vowel?” should stand out, as only 5 letters satisfy this. 
    Hence, all 5 vowels must be in the set of 10. The problem is now reduced to finding the set of 5 consonants.</p>
<p>Of the other sets, the “Is it the symbol of an element in groups 14 to 17?” is probably the most restrictive. 
    The only letters which satisfy this are CFINOPS, of which 2 are vowels. Hence, 3 of the consonants out of 
    CFNPS must be in the set. This limits the number of total set possibilities to (5 choose 3) x (16 choose 2) = 
    1200. This process can be repeated with other sets to narrow down the possibilities. Alternatively, all 1200 
    possibilities can be generated on a spreadsheet, and the number of “yes” answers calculated using formulas. See     
<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1coTSfT5wivpYnf0E49Vqw0-djfh5evFzQFG_uVu33nU/edit?usp=sharing">this 
  example working</a>.</p>
<p>An alternative approach to this minipuzzle is to observe that the problem can be reduced to a system of linear 
    equations whose variables are 0 or 1, an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) problem. For example, one such 
    equation for the horizontal line of symmetry would be HAxA + HBxB + …. + HZxZ = 5, where each HA represents 
    whether that letter has a horizontal line of symmetry, 1 if it does and 0 if it doesnt, while each xA 
    represents whether that letter is in the set or not. Also, xA + xB + …. + xZ = 10 to reflect that there are 
    10 items in the set in total. An ILP solver (or other computational methods) can then be used to solve this 
    system of equations. For example, a relatively accessible and fast way to do this could be using the 
    <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/define-and-solve-a-problem-by-using-solver-5d1a388f-079d-43ac-a7eb-f63e45925040">
      Solver add-in for Microsoft Excel</a>.</p>
<p>Regardless of which approach is used, the set of letters which satisfy all criteria is A,C,E,I,L,O,P,S,U,X. 
    Taking these in the order provided gives the mini-puzzle answer <span class="answer">CUPOLAS</span>.</p>

<h2>Mini-puzzle 2 - Black and White II (by Celestine Lau)</h2>
<p>In this Death Match, each player starts with 99 points and competes by bidding using their points across 9 
  rounds. In the first round, one designated player (in this case Player 1, hereafter referred to as A, and 
  with Player 2 referred to as B) leads, subsequently, the winner of the previous round leads in the next round. 
  Each bid is represented by either Black, meaning a single-digit bid from 0-9, or White, meaning a double-digit 
  bid from 10-99. In addition, five lamps signal when each player’s remaining points fall below set amounts, for 
  example, the first 80-99 lamp turns off when the player’s remaining points fall to 79 and below.</p>
<p>Solvers are given the full run of the game as well as several statements by both players, and must deduce 
  how many points were played each round. The final extraction indicates to use 7 plays, where “A9” for example 
  refers to the amount played by A in round 9. This can be deduced using the following steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li><p>In round 1, A played White and B responded with Black. Since all single digit values would lose, B, being 
    rational, played 0. So B1 = 0.</p></li>
  <li><p>Now consider round 2 and the information available to B thus far (A’s play of White in round 1 and Black 
    in round 2). The first White play could range from 10-19 (if it were 20 and above, the 80-99 lamp would turn 
    off), and the second play could range from 0-9. Since these possibilities are equally likely to B, a play 
    with a 10% chance of winning must be 1. Hence, B2=1.</p></li>
  <li><p>Consider round 3. Given that B lost in round 2, they now know that A played at least 2 in round 2, and at 
    least 12 overall. After A’s round 3 White play, their total points are between 60-79, hence their range of 
    possible values is 10-27. As B thinks their play has over 50% chance of winning, they must have played at 
    least 20. So B3 &gt;= 20.</p></li>
  <li><p>Now consider A’s statement in round 4. A knows that B played 0 in round 1 and 1 in round 2, and some value 
    20 or above in round 3 for a total of 21 and above. Hence, B’s lead of Black in round 4 could be any value 
    from 0-9 as the lamps did not change. Since a 40% chance of winning corresponds to a play of 4, this means 
    that A currently has 64 left before the play. Instead, A plays the same value as in round 2 and loses, but 
    this also causes the 60-79 lamp to turn off, meaning that the A2 and A4 are greater than 4.</p></li>
  <li><p>
    Now we know that A1 + A2 + A3 = 35, A2 &gt;= 5, and A1 + A2 &lt; A3. This leads to a few possibilities:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If A2 is 5, A1 can be from 10-12 (inclusive) and A3 from 18-20 (inclusive)</li>
      <li>If A2 is 6, A1 can be from 10-11 (inclusive) and A3 from 18-19</li>
      <li>If A2 is 7, A1 must be 10 and A3 must be 18.</li>      
    </ul>
    <p>In summary, A2 is from 5-7, A1 is from 10-12 and A3 from 18-20.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Consider round 5. B leads White and still has 60-79. A knows that B1=0, B2=1, B3&gt;=20, and B4&gt;=6. Hence 
    the most that B could have played is 12. A hence plays 13 to guarantee the win, so A5 = 13. A’s subsequent 
    statement indicates that A1 = 12, therefore, A2 = 5 and A3 = 18.</p></li>
  <li><p>Consider B’s statement after round 5 that B5 = 2 * B4. The only possibility here is B4 = 6, B5 = 12. This 
    also means that B3 = 20 since B’s total is still 60 and above. All plays thus far are now known.</p></li>
  <li><p>Consider A’s lead in round 6. Since B can figure out all of A’s plays, B knows that A has 46 remaining 
    (99-12-5-18-5-13=46) and could have played at most 6 to still keep the 40-59 lamp on. Therefore, B’s 
    statement indicates that B6 = 7.</p></li>
  <li><p>Consider B’s statement in round 7. There is only one power of 2 between 20-39: 32. Hence, B7 = 60-7-32 = 21. 
    A responds Black which rationally is 0 so A7=0.</p></li>
  <li><p>Finally, consider A’s statement in round 8, as this statement clues both rounds since both players will 
      play all their remaining points in round 9. A knows that B has 32 remaining and has played White with 0-19 
      remaining, therefore the range of possible values is 13-32. In order to deduce how much A has left (let’s 
      denote this value as T) and hence deduce the value of A6, one must take into account that there are 2 plays 
      avaiable now that give a 50% chance of winning the entire game and 5% chance of a draw.</p>
    <p>There are 20 possible values from 13-32, so that means that whatever A played would win for 10 of these 
      values, and draw for 1. This means A8 must be greater than B8, and T-A8 must be greater than 32-B8 for 10 
      possible values of B8, and either A8=B8 or T-A8=32-B8 for one possible B8. This indicates there is “wiggle 
      room” of exactly 10 for the value of a particular B8 to vary for A to still win both rounds, which is only 
      possible if T is exactly 11 greater than 32, which is 43.</p>
    <p>A quick inductive exercise can show that this is true. Say A had exactly 34 left. There would be exactly 
      1 way or 5% chance to win, which is for A8 to be 1 more than B8 (such that 34-A8 is also greater than 32-B8). 
      If A had 35, there would be a 10% chance to win. Continuing with this line of induction, A would have a 50% 
      chance of winning with 43 remaining. Hence A6 = 46-43 = 3.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>With 43 remaining, a play of 23 or 33 would have a 50% chance of winning and 5% chance of draw. If A8=23, 
    A would win if B played 13-22, and draw if B played 23. If A8=33, A would win if B played 23-32, and draw if B 
    played 22. Note that playing between 24 and 32 would give A a 50% chance of winning and 10% chance of draw. 
    Given that A still had 20-39 left after round 8, A8=23 and A9=20. </p></li>
  <li><p>There is insufficient information to determine B8 and B9 accurately. However, since they are not required 
    for extraction, their values are not important.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Take the given values and convert them using A=1,Z=26, giving the mini-puzzle answer <span class="answer">TACTFUL</span>.</p>

<h2>Mini-puzzle 5 – Monorail (by Kah Kien Ong)</h2>
<p>This Death Match is a game of 
  <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1910/venice-connection">Venice Connection</a>. The goal is to solve 
  for the next winning move in the 8 given positions, based on this game’s (Nim-like) rules that players can 
  alternatingly place 1-3 connected tiles in a row each turn, and the player who places the last valid tile to 
  complete the path wins. All these given positions require all the 16 available tiles to form a complete loop, 
  so the paths are unique. The positions are split into two columns/sets of 4, color-coded by yellow and orange 
  above the starting 2 station tiles. The full paths and next winning moves for each position are summarized in 
  the table below:</p>

</table>
<p>Below are the explanations for the unique next winning moves in blue above:</p>
<p>
  <u>For position Yellow-2:</u><br>
  The four remaining tiles in red in the path are all separated. So the opposing player must next place 
  one and our player can place other, and so on one more time to win.
</p>
<p>Making any other move loses as it allows the opposing player to make a move and leave a similar state with 
  four single separate tiles instead.</p>
<p>
  <u>For positions Yellow-4 and Orange-4:</u><br>
  The remaining tiles in red in the path are 3 tiles forming an L-shape, and a pair of separated single tiles. 
  The corner of the L-shaped grouping is not connected to another tile, so the opposing player cannot place only 
  that corner. If the opposing player places in this L-shaped grouping, our player can place the remaining tile/s 
  there, leaving two separated single tiles for a win (and vice versa if the opposing player places a single tile first). 
</p>
<p>Making any other move in the 4-tile grouping loses as it allows the opposing player to make a move and leave a 
  similar state instead. Placing two tiles in the L-shape grouping loses as the opposing player can make a move 
  and leave four single separate tiles. Placing one tile in the L-shape grouping allows the opposing player to make 
  a move and leave heaps of 3,2,1 which is also a loss state. </p>
<p>
  <u>For all the other positions:</u><br>
  The two remaining tiles in red in the path are separated. So the opposing player must next place either one and our 
  player can place the other to win.
</p>
<p>Making any other move loses as it allows the opposing player to make a move and leave a similar state with two single 
  separate tiles instead.</p>
<p>The positions of the 2 starting station tiles are lined up in each column for the yellow and orange sets. If the 
  4 positions in each set are overlaid with the stations aligned, the tiles used in the next winning moves do not 
  overlap and forms the following tracing of the letters for <span class="answer">CALORIE</span>, the answer to this

<h2>Mini-puzzle 6 - Open, Pass (by Steve Kaltenbaugh; tech by Sahil)</h2>
<p>In this Main Match, players must complete 3 rounds of Open, Pass, hitting a target number of points each round. 
  At the beginning of each round, players are given a deck of 30 cards, from which they must choose 20 to play 
  with. Cards either have numbers (1-10) or arithmetic operators (+/X), and have either a red, blue, or black back.</p>
<p>After the player selects their deck, it is shuffled and laid out, face down. One by one, the player chooses to 
  “open” or “pass” a card. “Opening” a card flips it over and adds it to a 10-card mathematical equation, starting 
  from the end. Players continue “opening” and “passing” cards until all 10 cards are in the equation. The equation 
  is then evaluated, using standard order-of-operations rules. If multiple numbers or operators are placed side by 
  side, only the leftmost number or operator is counted and the others are discarded. Additionally, if the sequence 
  begins with an operator, a 0 card is placed at the start of the operator, and if the sequence ends with an operator, 
  that operator is discarded. For example, if the first card is X (multiplication), the equation would begin 0 times… 
  and thus score low.</p>
<p>Players can use logic and the card back colors to choose an optimal deck and provide themselves with information 
  during the game. For instance, only choosing red cards with high numerical values allows the player to hold off 
  until a red card to play for a high score.</p>
<p>Additionally, during Round 3 players have the option of flipping the card upside down. This tactic allows players 
  to discern multiplication signs from other blue or black cards, making the round significantly easier.</p>
<p>Upon completing Round 3, players are given the answer <span class="answer">ROADMAP</span>.</p>

<h2>Mini-puzzle 7 – Truth Detector (by Kah Kien Ong)</h2>
<p>In this Death Match, each player chooses a secret 4-digit number which the other player has to guess by taking 
  turns to ask questions. Player has to answer every question with a lie, otherwise the alarm sounds and the player 
  has to reveal a digit not in their number, which happened in two of the turns. So the other given answers have to 
  be interpreted as lies in order to figure out each player’s number from the questions.  The solving steps for each 
  player’s number is independent and can be inferred separately based on their responses, as follows:</p>
<u><b>Inferences based on inverted responses for PLAYER1 by clue: </b></u>
<ol>
  <li>First digit is smallest or joint smallest</li>
  <li>Second digit is largest or joint largest</li>
  <li>Last digit is second smallest or joint second smallest</li>
  <li>Sum of digits equals 5</li>
  <li>Performing iterative 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaprekar%27s_routine">Kaprekar’s routine</a> on any 4-digit number will 
    eventually reduce it to Kaprekar’s constant (6174). From the first 4 responses, PLAYER2 knows the number is one 
    of the 6 possibilities in the table below. Since another question is needed, this suffices to infer that the 
    number of iterations is not unique, so the last two possibilities can be eliminated.

<p>The instruction mentioned “getting the answers out of these players”, and one of the responses hints that the digit 
  0 is not important. So the digits of the numbers (ignoring the 0) can be used as indices to extract letters from 
  PLAYER1/PLAYER2 to give the 7-letter answer to this mini-puzzle <span class="answer">APPAREL</span>.</p>

<h2>Mini-puzzle 8 - Twelve Janggi (by Kah Kien Ong; tech by Sahil)</h2>
<p>This Death Match is similar to 
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C5%8Dbutsu_sh%C5%8Dgi">Dōbutsu Shōgi</a>, with the difference that pieces 
  may not para-drop onto the last rank. The goal is to solve for a forced mate in 4 by Player 1 (moving first), 
  and with Player 2 playing perfectly to delay the mate as long as possible</p>
<p>In the following game notations, rows are numbered a-c from top to bottom, and the columns are numbered 1-4 from 
  left to right. Cross symbol indicates capture, asterisk symbol indicates para-drop, and plus symbol indicates check.</p>
<p>To solve this mating sequence, one useful strategy is to first think of the final mating position required. As a 
  General delivers mate, the last move by Player 1 must place a General adjacent to the Player 2 King, with the King 
  having no other escape squares it can move to. The most straightforward way for this is to have the King at a4 and the 
  General at a3, with another General at b3 guarding the King’s only escape square at b4, and also protecting the General 
  at a3. It can be deduced that other possible final mating positions would require either too many moves, or imperfect 
  play by Player 2. Note however, that Player 2 can defend against this mate on a3 by placing a Minister at a3 or b4. So 
  the General needs to be first placed at a2, so that the Man can be dropped at a3 first to exchange off the defending 
  Minister. Hence the latter three moves are somewhat determined, and the first move must be to drop the General b3. There 
  is slight variation possible in how Player 2 drops/moves the Minister, as long as the Minister is able to  delay the mate 
  till move 4 by either capturing the Man on a3 or checking the King on c1.  </p>
<p>The correct 4-move mating sequence (including its variation lines) are:</p>
<table class="chess">

    <td>1.</td>

<h2>Mini-Meta – Garnet Tower Stacking (by Kah Kien Ong; art by Justin Ladia)</h2>
<p>As indicated in the instructions, this is a brand new Death Match, so solvers will need to first figure out the 
  rules and how to use the 8 answers (garnets) from the mini-puzzles. Note that all the 8 answers from the preceding 
  The Genius mini-puzzles are 7-letter words.</p>
<p>A modified image of the actual in-game garnet (a reward currency) is given with this mini-meta, which shows the 
  cubic garnet has a letter G (the logo for The Genius) traced around its edges, and with an arrowhead added indicating 
  a direction. The path covers 7 corners of the garnet (with the 8th being hidden out of view). So using this path, 
  it is possible to map each letter of the 7-letter answers onto the corners of its garnet, with the last corner being 
  an unknown letter, as shown in the letter/corner ordering based on the path in the garnet image below:</p>
<p>
  <img src="images/garnet-numbered.png" class="garnet-tower" alt="The garnet image from the puzzle with the vertices numbered along the path of the logo">
</p>
<p>The Death Match name clues that solvers need to stack up the 8 cubic garnets into a tower. As given in the flavortext, 
  in the stacked garnet tower, letters (including the unknown one) on adjacent faces of each level should match. Since 
  the garnets have letters mapped to each corner, the garnets should be oriented such that garnets in the tower have 
  matching letters on all adjacent corners. This serves as the rule and constraint for arranging the 8 garnets in order 
  and their relative orientation. As a hint and entry-point, the garnet that forms the base of the tower maps to the 
  answer <em>SUPPORT</em>. The order and orientation of the 8 answers on the garnets are shown below (entire tower can rotate 
  about the vertical axis without impacting the extraction):</p>  
<p>
  <img src="images/solved-tower.png" class="garnet-tower" alt="The assembled answer tower">
</p>
<p>Each pair of touching faces/corners includes 1 unknown letter, which is thus identified by the known letter on the 
  corner it touches. The 7 unknown letters identified in this manner, read in order from the base, spells the thematic 
  puzzle answer <span class="answer">OTHELLO</span>, which is another strategy game.</p>
