<p>Each four-way kissing session described:</p>

<ol>
	<li><p>Refers to a specific romantic comedy film (with the three non-first-person characters being participants in a love triangle).</p>
	<p>These films start with the letters A though N, thus providing an ordering.</p></li>
	<li><p>Corresponds to an arrangement of four mutually osculating (tangent) circles (as hinted at by the "other romantic shapes" in the flavortext, and "circles" in the verse).</p>
	<p>Descartes' Theorem gives a simple relation among the curvatures (reciprocals of radii, counted as negative for an enclosing circle) of sets of such circles:</p>

	<p>(W + X + Y + Z)<sup>2</sup> = 2(W<sup>2</sup> + X<sup>2</sup> + Y<sup>2</sup> + Z<sup>2</sup>)</p>

	<p>which enables you to get the two possibilities for one curvature from the other three by:</p>

	<p>W = X + Y + Z ± 2 * sqrt(XY + YZ + XZ)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>We treat the "bendiness scores" as curvatures, as indicated in the verse (note that the characters who "embrace" the others have only the absolute value of the bendiness
specified, since the value used in the formula must be negative) and get the score for the first-person speaker (taking the "high" or "low" bendiness as indicated), giving us:</p>

<p>The bendiness values we get are (as indicated by the verse) used to select words from the verse. Specifically, we take the numbers before and after the decimal point as the line and word number. As indicated by the verse, we take the initial sounds of these words, to get (as seen in the chart above) "now use soddy's poem." In 1936 Frederick Soddy rediscovered Descartes' Theorem, and published the result in the form of a poem, "The Kiss Precise" (to which the puzzle's title alludes), whose first stanza is:</p>

<p class="poem">For pairs of lips to kiss maybe<br>
Involves no trigonometry.<br>
‘Tis not so when four circles kiss<br>
Each one the other three.<br>
To bring this off the four must be<br>
As three in one or one in three.<br>
If one in three, beyond a doubt<br>
Each gets three kisses from without.<br>
If three in one, then is that one<br>
Thrice kissed internally.</p>

<p>Repeating the process with this poem gives "kitty in the big bus/buss." 
The answer is the actress who played Kitty in the movie <em>The Big Bus</em>, <span class="answer">STOCKARD CHANNING</span>.</p>
