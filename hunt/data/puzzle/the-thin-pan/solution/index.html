<p>The two investigators hosting the Nick-and-Nora-style dinner party are the chimpanzee scientists Cornelius and Zira from the original <em>Planet of the Apes</em>. Each of their guests is a fictional ape (orangutan, gorilla, bonobo, or chimpanzee) or a human being played by Charlton Heston in a film. (Bright Eyes is what Zira calls Charlton Heston's character in <em>Planet of the Apes</em>, and so she uses the same nickname for the similar-looking human beings here.)</p>

<p>Each guest has committed a crime against some other guest; the bolded words in the accusation clue a word that is a transaddition of the victim's name. The accusation also clues who the perpetrator is; to help in identification, the accusations are in alphabetical order by perpetrator.</p>

<p>In that order we have (using orange, yellow, green, cyan, and blue for orangutans, gorillas, human beings, bonobos, and chimpanzees):</p>
