<h2>Part 1</h2>

<p>The first part of the puzzle is a pure setting task, which is aided quite a bit by appropriate
programming. One method for solving the task is: download the wordlist; reduce it to all 5-letter
words; add all reversals of those 5-letter words; add the set of 6-letter words that are the
5-letter words with the alphabet-sum character appended; remove all 5-letter words that have
repeated letters; and use a crossword grid filler (such as the free one called Qxw, available
online), to fill a grid that looks like this:</p>

<pre class="centered">
??????
??????
??????
??????
??????
?????-
</pre>

<p>Solvers can either (1) keep trying to fill until the 5-letter words to the right and bottom
contain 10 different letters; (2) try a pattern like ?OILY on the right, which can
start with D, R, or S, and leaves a lot of good letters for the 5-letter word on the bottom, which
should yield a valid result quicker than simply proceeding at random; or (3) separate the wordlist
(described above) into 2 lists, one where the 6-letter entries end with one set of 13 letters, and
one where the 6-letter entries end with a letter from the complement of that set&mdash;then fill the
acrosses from one list and the downs from the other list (Qxw and some other commercial programs
allow this), ensuring a fill with 10-different letters to the right and bottom.</p>

<p>When solvers submit a string of 25 letters, it is checked by program, and if it meets all the
rules, solvers receive part 2 of the puzzle. One string that works is:
<span class="answer">ARECAGAVELIMIDEOITARSEERT</span>.</p>

<h2>Part 2</h2>

<p>The second part of the puzzle consists of 10 clues to a cryptic double-square puzzle with 17
bigrams underneath.</p>

<p>The solutions to the cryptic clues are:</p>

<p>The solution to the double-square is (words can read forwards or backwards):</p>

<p>Along with the puzzle, solvers are given a set of bigrams corresponding to the above coordinates
<span class="callout monospace">20-57-61-48-19-05-39-82-10-85-58-94-83-72-93-16-71</span> except
instead of pairs of digits they are given pairs of letters. Those letters correspond to the two
5-letter right and bottom words that solvers submitted in the Part 1 task&mdash;which were
constrained to be 10 different letters, so they can act unambiguously as a coordinate system.

<p>Solvers will use the provided bigrams to extract letters from the Double Word Square of part 2,
using the coordinate system they unwittingly provided in part 1, to get
<span class="callout answer">LAD ON FIRST TV GUIDE</span>
and that uniquely identifies <span class="answer">DESI ARNAZ JR</span> (to be entered in this
fashion, per the instruction that the form of the answer must be the title of a Wikipedia article).</p>
