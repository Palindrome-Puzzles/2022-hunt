[[0.0, ["start", " What type of puzzle is this?"], "The puzzle is a set of logic puzzles known as \"Hashi\" or \"Bridges\""], [10.0, ["What are the rules?"], "The rules for a Hashi puzzle can be found online. In a STANDARD Hashi puzzle, you build 1 or 2 bridges from each numbered island to one or more islands directly north, south, east, and/or west, so an island can have a maximum of 8 (2 in each direction), and every island must have at least 1. In this Hashi triplet, some of the island numbers must be figured out by logic."], [20.0, ["Getting started"], "A lot of progress can be made by simply using the numbered islands and not worrying about the symbols yet. Fill in as much as you can -- you will often be able to tell whether a direction from a particular island has exactly 0, exactly 1, exactly 2, or at least 1 bridge extending from it. Write in all the \"obvious\" things, and then see if that creates new \"obvious\" things that you can fill in, and so on."], [30.0, ["How to deal with the symbols"], "After you have filled in as much a you can without regard to the symbols, it is time to tackle the symbols. The fact that the symbols are given in numerical order with the island names is very useful. For example -- an island in a corner can have at most 4 bridges attached, so if for example a corner island symbol was known to be X / 5 / 6, it would have to be the X. Or if known to be 3 / X ./ 6 but the 3 was used in a different grid, it would be known to be exactly a 4."], [100.0, ["extraction"], "For each of the named islands, total the bridges connecting to that island across all seasons."], [100.1, ["extraction part 2"], "Convert each island's yearly number of bridges to an alphabet letter (A = 1, etc.). Then read those letters off in a logical order."]]
