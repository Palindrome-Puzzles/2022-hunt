<li>Male voice (American accent): Yeah, that's true. It's absolutely true, and I didn't really read the script. I was, like, you know I kind of &ndash; I'd love to do a trailer with one of these animated movies. It'd be kind of fun. I'm looking at Joel Coen &ndash; one of my favorites &ndash; I mean the Coen Brothers, these guys make great movies. Well, it wasn't that Joel Coen, it was a different Joel Cohen.</li>
<li>Female voice (American accent): I just found out about this last week. There is, has always been available to all, everybody that does a negotiation on a film, an inclusion rider, which means that you can ask for, and/or demand, at least 50% diversity in not only the casting, but also the crew. And so the fact that we &ndash; that I just learned that after 35 years of being in the film business, it's not, we're not going back. So the whole idea of women trending: no, no trending. African-Americans trending: no, no trending. It changes now, and I think the inclusion rider will have something to do with that.</li>
<li>Male voice (American accent): The book is autobiographical, the film is autobiographical in certain aspects for me and for Mike Nichols and for Larry Turman and probably for Dustin, too.</li>
<li>Male voice (English accent): Driving people in a car, singing songs &hellip; great, people are gonna love this.</li>
<li>Female voice (American accent): Yes, they would &hellip; they would always ask, "and what does your father do?" First of all, I had to overcome being from California, which, you know, they thought you took a covered wagon to get there, and then it was totally the land of Philistines. And who's to say they were wrong, but and then they would say, "And what does your father do exactly?" And I said, "Well, he's a ventriloquist." And they said, "Really, what is a ventriloquist?" I said, "Well, he, he made his living talking to dolls on the radio." And they'd go, "Really? Talking to dolls on the radio? How amusing." And then they'd leave. And so then I just would say he's, he's in real estate.</li>
<li>Female voice (English accent): He said, "I fancy that Mary Poppins has a secret life, a kind of quiet pleasure at being a little wicked."</li>
<li>Male voice (English accent): My father calls me something else &hellip; but it's unrepeatable. Um &hellip; I got it when I was about 16. I was playing in bands in Newcastle, and I used to wear a jumper rather like this, and it was black and yellow. Right. Hoops. And I looked like a wasp or so, so they said.</li>

<li>Male voice (American accent): I wasn't confident enough to direct myself at the first movie, and I really wanted to focus on directing, and I really wanted people to see how talented I knew my brother was, so there was definitely an added level of pressure with <i>The Town</i> in the sense that I was going to be in it as well &hellip;</li>
<li>Male voice (American accent): It's a bigger hit if I sing my name at the front, you know, obviously. So yeah, I had to, you know, bring that back, and I was actually wondering why other people didn't sing my name at the front of their songs as well because it works so well for me.</li>
<li>Female voice (American accent): But eventually, they got curious, and then I didn't want to be, like, coveting and weird [Male voice with American accent interrupts to say "right"], so I was, like, "Sure. Yeah, you can watch it." I wanted it to be their choice, not me pushing it on them. They love &hellip; they call them "mom movies," which is so sweet. And for they love <i>50 First Dates</i> and <i>Ever After.</i></li>
<li>Female voice (English accent): I think she's done, she's done the work, she's done the work that, that, that is deserving of representation of her on currency, and I think that it will happen because there's no reason to not have it happen.</li>
<li>Female voice (American accent): Yes, you've guessed &ndash; you finally get to know what happens in Budapest.</li>
<li>Male voice (American accent): Oh, that! Oh my lord, that came up out of absolutely nowhere, because I got, I got a text from one of my kids, he says, "Dad, they're saying you're a citizen of Greece." I said, "No, I'm not. Wait a minute!" And then it turned out to be this very nice thing that the Greek government did. And I thought, honestly, by marrying a Greek woman, I thought that already covered all those bases.</li>
<li>Male voice (American accent): One of the craziest things you'll ever see. I discovered it literally 20 years ago with my wife. We were visiting her family in Sweden and we had had dinner and all of a sudden her cousin was like, so, shall we watch Eurovision? And I was like, okay, yeah, what's that and, and sat there for three hours mesmerized by &ndash; I had no idea what was going on.</li>

<li>Male voice (American accent): I don't think we consciously think about the audience needing to relate to every single song we that we write; however, hopefully we're choosing moments that are relatable and are universal and even in a very specific story, even when you're writing about some specific moment, like <i>James and the Giant Peach,</i> when he's singing the song "Middle of the Moment," he sort of has this opportunity to go into the peach, and is he going to do it or not? He's there. He's stuck in this moment and feels like he has no other options. He sees an option. Is he brave enough to do it?</li>
<li>Female voice (American accent): We go to a place called "The Great Before," where souls come from</li>
<li>Male voice (American accent): You're less likely to be asked to do something that you haven't done before than something that you've &hellip; you've &hellip; sinister things, villainous types. I kind of got a ball rolling on it somewhere, and it sticks. I'm happy, you know, I'm happy about it. It keeps me working.</li>
<li>Male voice (American accent): And I saw the show, and I thought it was really, really terrific, and I love the whole style of it. They write all the scripts, but we get to screw around, you know, in between, and right from the very beginning, and I'm a little older than they are</li>
<li>Female voice (American accent): I'm a dancer, and I've been dancing professionally for a long time. But I really wanted to portray another dancer from a completely different discipline, a completely .. you know, being a, having a pole behind you, that's the apparatus, first of all, and then you start thinking about like, oh my gosh, these women do this day in and day out.</li>
<li>Female voice (American accent): I moved to New York thinking I was going to finish college at FIT and go into fashion, because that's what I've always loved and what I for sure thought I was doing, and I had already done a couple years in college. And the second night I was here, my friend had me do stand-up, and literally it was like, "I guess I won't go back to college."</li>
<li>Male voice (English accent): Now my association with Watford is &ndash; was one of the main reasons I stayed in this country is I couldn't give up Watford football club and all the people involved who I really like, you know. They've meant more to me &ndash; they give more to me in a way than I could possibly ever give to them monetarily.</li>

<li>Female voice (Australian accent): Because yeah, like law degree is like five years total, a combined law degree. And I was already on Australian television by like year two [male voice with American accent interrupts: "Right"], and they were like, what is she? And also because I play a lot of dumb characters, so people were very confused. [male voice with American accent interrupts: "Yeah"] That what I was doing in, like, the contract law exam</li>
<li>Male voice (American accent): Oh sure, I didn't know that Charlton was doing this, "This is CNBC" until I was told, because he was a very particular choice he made in not &ndash; not that he's trying to disguise his voice any more than I do, but they're just choices you make</li>
<li>Female voice (American accent): Am I supposed to sing like me? Am I supposed to sing like her? Okay, how am I supposed to blend the two? What is expected? Like these are the questions that's going through my mind. But as an actor, this ain't got nothing to do with me. Like, and this to me, I'm an actress first that's portraying, you know, a singer in the story. So I had to look at it from that way. If that makes any sense.</li>
<li>Male voice (American accent): But what's interesting about this year is that I have a laptop in the back that they've given me and I can actually see the votes coming in, and I can see how many exactly have come in and how they're jumping back and forth. I can't reveal it</li>
<li>Male voice (American accent): Donald Sutherland, one of my best partners, great actor, said to me, "What good does it do to know everything when you don't understand anything?"</li>
<li>Male voice (American accent): The more I go into into like a particular culture, which is what we tried to do because we didn't want to do like a generalized Africa. You know, you needed to be able to pull from, you know, the whole continent in order to create this fictitious African nation.</li>

<summary>Row 5</summary>
<ol>
<li>Female voice (English accent): I work in a job that is very demanding. And I also work in a company that just has so much history and so many legendary dancers have danced there before. So, in a way there are definitely very big shoes to fill, so to speak, very big ballet shoes, metaphorically, so to speak. Every time I step on stage, I know that there's a certain level that is expected of me.</li>
<li>Female voice (English accent): I was brought up in a very &ndash; I'm getting round to the Queen &ndash; I was brought up in a very anti-monarchist household, both my mum and my dad really, really thought it was a load of old rubbish, you know, the monarchy, and it was silly. And they've got a point. You know, why, what, what's it for, really? What's it all about? So I'd grown up with those sort of attitudes. But yeah, certainly playing the Queen and making me &hellip; forcing myself to enter into who this person is, and really come to a realization of what she'd done with her life and the way in which she'd done it. I found a huge admiration for her growing in me</li>
<li>Male voice (American accent): Obviously, I can't wait for theaters to be open again, but this has been always something I wanted to do, I wanted to open up a flower shop, and it feels like no better time but now, and honing our craft, honing our skills, and I partnered with Adam Perry who's an incredible florist</li>
<li>Female voice (American accent): Well obviously, we wanted to go on tour but couldn't do that, and so we're doing a virtual event tonight where we're going to have a panel about the making and the meaning of <i>Acoustic Soul</i></li>
<li>Female voice (English accent): And the idea is that each short story begins with a piece of Matisse artwork; that's what kind of brings the story into, kind of, into time. And for Susannah's character in <i>Medusa's Ankles,</i> it's her seeing this Matisse poster hanging in this hair salon that brings her in in the first place</li>
<li>Male voice (English accent): Then they come up with a film! And of course I was absolutely devastated, because you know they've been videoing me and drawing me all that time, and I see the film and there's this scrawny bloody lion!</li>
<li>Male voice (American accent): I was supposed to be Tom Hanks' lover [male voice with American accent interrupts: "uh-huh"], but I didn't think he was good looking enough for me. I wanted, like, Kevin Costner, Denzel Washington, and so I turned it down for Super Mario Brothers.</li>

<li>Female voice (American accent): Well, this is the new version of <i>Inside the Actors Studio,</i> and Al had done it years ago</li>
<li>Male voice (American accent): The story is about an illegal war against the Colombian drug cartels being connect, conducted by the president, the National Security Advisor, and the operations branch of CIA, and Jack Ryan has now been elevated to the head of intelligence of CIA</li>
<li>Male voice (American accent): So the new album is <i>Beautiful Revolution Pt. 2.</i> I put out part one, like, in last October. Part two is really &hellip; it's the the evolution of part one</li>
<li>Male voice (American accent): You know, I have to say, there was a long time in my life. You know, I'm gonna turn 50 this year. I've been in the business for 30 years. You know, there was a period of time when I first started where, you know, there was a homophobic silencing of every instinct that I had as a human being on this planet. And I'm reclaiming my time.</li>
<li>Male voice (American accent): Where Alfie &ndash; I knew how important that song could be. I knew how powerful that movie was.</li>
<li>Female voice (American accent): Oh, I do, I do, I mean, I tell people so often, you know, they say, "Oh my gosh, being Elvira must be so wild," and I said, "You have no idea. Before I was Elvira, it was much much wilder."</li>
<li>Female voice (American accent): So &hellip; you know &hellip; I made this decision about 18 months ago, Shonda Rhimes wrote me off <i>Scandal</i> &ndash; it was fine &ndash; I called Mitch Hurwitz, who's the creator of <i>Arrested Development,</i> and I said, "If there is a season five, I won't be doing it, because I quit acting."</li>

<li>Male voice (American accent): Oh, yeah. Oh yeah. I used to, I used to hang out on the terrace and write. Yep, I did, I wrote, I wrote most of <i>Sunday</i> up there</li>
<li>Female voice (English accent): I think acting is &hellip; I think it's always talked about. It shouldn't be talked about, it should be done, and it should either be a success or not a success. Just get on. Tell the story.</li>
<li>Male voice (American accent): I meant all. Of both of them. Jane not only is one of the most incredible actresses I've ever seen. And I have to say that I'm not surprised, because I saw her do things early before she committed herself that I thought if she ever does want to she's going to make it.</li>
<li>Male voice (American accent): My character happens to be in a, in a place in his life where he's in, he's in transition. Like the &ndash; and I think it's because of the transition that Midge is in that you know that my daughter is going through. All her changes are impacting all of the people around her.</li>
<li>Male voice (American accent): I mean, it's rock and roll. And people have weird names. But everybody just kept talking about my name. I just, if somebody asked me about my name, I'd make up a story, right? But the true story is my dad was a policeman. And I was born bright red. I stayed red. So the doctor's suggested I should stay in the hospital a bit longer. So he comes to the hospital dressed in his uniform, I guess one day, and talks the nurses and he said &ndash; I'm doing the best Texas accent &ndash; "My son looks like four and a half pounds of ground chuck."</li>
<li>Female voice (English accent): I lie, I fully lie, I hold my hand up, I let him go. Plus &ndash; he just should have tried harder to get on that door.</li>
<li>Male voice (American accent): It's just like I'm in Washington Heights, thank you.</li>
