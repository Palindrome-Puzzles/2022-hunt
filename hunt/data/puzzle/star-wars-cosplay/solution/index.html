<p>
  Each of the 13 video clips is a scene from <i>Star Wars</i> (1977). In addition, three clues have been added to the video using a Star Wars-style crawl. Many clues are Star Wars-flavored, but the surface reading is irrelevant.
</p>
<p>
  The three clues constitute a Celebrity Disguises puzzle, leading to the name of a famous person: One is an anagram of the celebrity's name (plus two extra letters), one has the same initials, and one has the same enumeration and vowel/consonant pattern (Y is considered a vowel).
</p>
<p>
  The three clues have been alphabetized, but you can figure out which is which because the initials need to be in the anagram, and the anagram is always two letters longer than the V/C pattern. Figuring out the disguised celebrities then leads to the realization that all 13 are depicted on the album cover art of the Beatles' <i>Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band</i>. In addition, taking the two extra letters from each anagram (in the order they appear in the anagram), and sorting the videos by their order in <i>Star Wars</i>, reveals the message LEGEND NUMBER IN CD LINER NOTES.
</p>
<p>
  The original cover art of <i>Sgt. Pepper</i> had an identification chart (distributed with the CD, if not all versions of the original LP) with a legend that numbers all of the people on the cover from 1 to 70(ish). So each of the celebrities has a canonical number associated with them via this legend.
</p>
<p>
  What do we do with these numbers? Actually, that turns out not to be the relevant question to ask. The relevant question to ask is, "What does <i>Sgt. Pepper</i> have to do with <i>Star Wars</i>?" The connection is a different "cover" of <i>Sgt. Pepper</i>: <a href="https://www.paletteswapninja.com/2017/05/01/new-album-princess-leias-stolen-death-star-plans/"><i>Princess Leia's Stolen Death Star Plans</i></a> is a remake of <i>Sgt. Pepper</i> with all the lyrics changed to match the entire plot of <i>Star Wars</i>.

<p>
  Now we can match each video clip to a corresponding track from <i>PLSDSP</i> (either by matching the scene or just by ordering the clips chronologically within the movie). We can use the legend number of the corresponding celebrities as indices, because the celebrities with large numbers match up with long track titles from <i>PLSDSP</i>. Taking the celebrity number and indexing into the corresponding song title from <i>PLSDSP</i>, then reading off in the original order of the videos (which we haven't used yet), gives WNBA STORM CITY, a clue phrase leading to the puzzle answer <span class="answer">SEATTLE</span>.

    <h2>Author's Note</h2>
    <p>This puzzle exists because more people need to know about <em>Princess Leia's Stolen Death Star Plans</em>, which is magnificent. At times during the writing process, we toyed around with different extraction mechanisms involving pulling one word from the lyrics to each track of <em>PLSDSP</em> to make a 13-word clue phrase; somewhat surprisingly, it was quite possible to uniquely pin <b>SEATTLE</b> using that limited vocabulary, because of the 1969 Seattle Pilots ("Wake up, a <b>pilot</b> said") and their central role in the memoir Ball Four by Jim Bouton ("The training <b>ball</b> will float" / "One, two, Yavin <b>IV</b>"). But the task of trying to pin a particular word in the lyrics in a given track turned out to be way too fiddly, so we abandoned it and settled for good old indexing into titles; by the time you've figured out that the puzzle is about <em>PLSDSP</em>, you deserve to finish it quickly.</p>

    <p>Testsolving groups for this puzzle varied widely in A) whether they had ever heard of a Celebrity Disguises puzzle (of the kind occasionally featured in Games magazine), and B) whether they'd heard of <em>PLSDSP</em> itself. Celebrity Disguises was much less broadly familiar than we had thought, which is why all three types of clues are hinted in the final version of the flavortext. Several testsolvers who came in not knowing the album mentioned after testsolving that they have added a new tool to their "have you tried?" toolkit: "Why is this puzzle about X actually a puzzle about Y?" In fact, both Brandon and joon came away with a renewed appreciation for this tool as well, so we recommend it to anyone. May it serve you well, and may the Force be with you.</p>
