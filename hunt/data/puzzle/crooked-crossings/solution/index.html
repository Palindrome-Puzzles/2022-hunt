  The theme of this puzzle is “bridges”, as clued by the title and flavortext. The first
  step for solvers is to bridge and match the right pairs of clues by inserting the word
  “bridges” in-between, then figure out the 10 thematic clue answers below:

    <th>Left Side of Pair</th>
    <th>Correct Right Side of Pair</th>
    <th>Pair Answer</th>

    <td>END</td>

    <td>normally experience and are affected by (6)</td>

  The 10 clue answers can be traced out by orthogonal linkways or bridges in the provided
  wraparound grid (as shown in the given samples) like a Twisty Wordsearch. A given
  constraint is that each point-to-point crossing can comprise at most 2 bridges. This
  rule, together with the bridges theme and presentation of the grid resembling a
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashiwokakero">Hashiwokakero</a> puzzle, also
  clue the standard Hashiwokakero rule that bridges do not cross. And as indicated in the
  flavortext, in this variant, there are exactly 3 point-to point crossings which may bend
  at the marked positions.
</p>

<p>
  The solution grid that connects all the clue answers within these constraints is shown
  at the end of this solution (using the color-coded bridges corresponding to the clue
  pairing image alongside the grid). Note that the starting T in TREE and TRESTLE could
  swap (but one must connect to T6 as given), and this will not affect the extraction.
</p>

<p>
  Going back to the Hashiwokakero reference, such puzzles are given with numbered
  points/islands corresponding to the total number of bridges connecting to that
  point/island, for solving. Hence for this puzzle, solvers now have to reverse the
  Hashiwokakero solving process to count the total number of bridges connecting to each
  point/letter. There are a total of 84 bridges, and the solution grid has exactly 3
  letters (hinted by the trio of crooked bridges) with the same number of bridges
  connecting to them (from 1 to 7). These numbers have been indicated alongside the
  letters in the solution grid at the end of this solution.
</p>

<p>
  The 7 numbered arrows given at the end of the puzzle indicate the direction (from the
  given grid position) to read off the respective trigrams/trio of letters corresponding
  with each number. This yields the extraction clue phrase below:

  There are 15 unused letters in the solution grid not connected by any bridges
  (highlighted in green). Reading off the third letters of these (highlighted in bright
  green) gives the answer to this puzzle <span class="answer">BROOK</span>, another
  thematic connection to bridges.
