<p>
  Most sets of instructions can be resolved without much look-ahead, but there are 2 situations in which looking ahead to things that will happen in later Instructions will provide useful information that can help resolve situations occurring several Instructions earlier.
</p>
<p>
  (LOOKAHEAD 1) Instruction 10B says that the car following this Instruction turns left <span class="emphasis">for the first time</span>. After completing Instruction 5, solvers know this must be the DODGE (because all other cars have turned left by then), so the DODGE cannot make any left turns during Instructions 6-9, and must perform 10B, which is useful in figuring out the proper paths without the need for brute force, especially during Instructions 7-9.
</p>
<p>
  (LOOKAHEAD 2) Instruction 12 indicates that 3 of the scratchpads have at least 3 letters each, and the other has at least one letter. Since exactly 10 letters have been added up to that point, that means the scratchpads have EXACTLY 3-3-3-1 letters going into Instruction 12. That in turn means that the letter added in Instruction 11D – resulting in that scratchpad not having the same number of letters as any other – must have been the very first letter added to that pad. By the end of Instruction 4, we know that FORD, JEEP, and TESLA have all added letters to their scratchpads, so the car with the blank scratchpad until Instruction 11D must be the DODGE (which must perform Instruction 11D, and thus which cannot perform any “add a letter” instruction before 11D). This conclusion is also very useful in determining the proper paths without the need for brute force, especially during Instructions 7-9.
</p>
<p>
  These conclusions, together with the following more localized logical conclusions, will see cars through the entire route without the need to brute force any significant strings of hypothetical paths.
</p>

<ol class="instructions">
  <li>
    <p>
      Only JEEP can get to the third intersection, so must be D. Of the rest, only DODGE can get to the second intersection, so must be B. FORD can only go left at first Intersection, so must be A. That leaves D for TESLA.

      X starts out as 4. DODGE and JEEP need X=4, FORD needs X=3; and JEEP turns X from 4 to 3, so the ordering is DODGE/JEEP/FORD, with TESLA (able to turn 3 or 4) added somewhere. (By examination, the only time X can change is when JEEP turns – then X=3.)
    </p>
    <p>
      TESLA cannot be A else DODGE is 2 B’s in a row, and cannot be D else FORD is 2 Cs in a row. So DODGE is A, FORD is D, and JEEP/TESLA are B and C in some order.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regardless of what happens here, JEEP must do Instruction 3C next time (see analysis in next cell), so cannot do Instruction 2C, so the order for 2 is: D/J/T/F.

    <p>
      JEEP cannot physically do D (since 2 cars cannot get earlier than ALEXANDRA to leave an “only” car alphabetically later), so must do A or C. If A, it ends on MESQUITE, and then no one can do D (TESLA would have 2 cars later than HORIZON or McMAHON – whichever it is on after doing 2B or 2C -- DODGE is B, and FORD did D last time). So JEEP must do C, landing on GOLDFINCH. (This means that JEEP cannot have done 2C, so JEEP did 2B and TESLA did 2C, fully resolving Instruction 2.)

    <p>
      FORD did D last time, so must do A now, leaving D for TESLA.

      Neither JEEP nor DODGE can physically do A, and FORD is not allowed, so A is TESLA.
    </p>
    <p>
      The X in C will be 2, since that is TESLA’s number at the start of this round, and B swaps with it, and C uses B’s then-current number. But DODGE cannot turn right at 2d intersection (only left there), so DODGE cannot physically do C and is not allowed to do B, so must be D (at which time X is 3, after the swaps).
    </p>
    <p>
      So only B and C are unaccounted, and since JEEP did C last time, it must do B this time, leaving C for FORD.
    </p>
    <p>
      NOTE: TESLA (here) and FORD (in Instruction 1) have now each turned left (relevant to later Instruction 10B, where a car then turns left for the first time in the event) – see LOOKAHEAD 1, discussed above.

      According to LOOKAHEAD 2 (discussed in the preamble above), one car must add a letter to its scratchpad for the first time during Instruction 11D. By the end of Instruction 4, all cars except DODGE have added something to their scratchpad, so DODGE must remain blank until Instruction 11D. So DODGE cannot be B or C, and is not allowed to repeat D, so must be A.
    </p>
    <p>
      FORD cannot do D (its first intersection is left), and is not allowed to repeat C, so must do B.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESLA cannot physically do C, so must do D. Which leaves C for JEEP.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now FORD, TESLA, and JEEP have all turned left in this event, so since Instruction 10B has a car turning left for the first time, that car must be DODGE, and DODGE cannot turn left prior to Instruction 10B (LOOKAHEAD 1, discussed in the preamble above).
