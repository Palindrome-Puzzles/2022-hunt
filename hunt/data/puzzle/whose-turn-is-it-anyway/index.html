      <p>
        Throughout this event, consider the information on Google Maps Street View to be correct and canonical. The only streets and portions of streets that exist for purposes of this event are those that you can travel on in Google Maps Street View (most, but not all, of which are named). You may want to keep the Street View portion at the top of your screen and the navigation map view, with blue lines showing where Street View exists, at the bottom, which is how the links above will open up. For all purposes, use street names indicated by street-naming signs visible in Street View, and always ignore North, South, East, West, and the abbreviations N, S, E, W when appearing at the beginning of a street name. (There is no trickery here – street names and signs are not always consistent as to such matters.)
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Each car on the team must complete a different one of the Instructions 1A, 1B, 1C, and 1D. Instruction 1A must be done completely before 1B, which must be done completely before 1C, which must be done completely before 1D. <span class="emphasis">Importantly, that this means a fact that existed when Part A of an Instruction was being worked on might be different when Part B of the Instruction is thereafter being worked on.</span> Then, all four cars move on to Instruction 2, each taking exactly one of 2A, 2B, 2C, and 2D, all different, and performed one at a time in A, B, C, D order. Continue in this manner until all Instructions have been completed. After finishing an Instruction and until it is time to consider its next Instruction, a car slows down so that it does not pass any intersections or other landmarks that might be relevant to its next Instruction.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        The same car cannot perform an Instruction having the same letter designation in 2 consecutive rounds. For example, if a car performs Instruction 1A, it cannot perform Instruction 2A. But after performing, for example, 1A and then 2B, it may perform Instruction 3A – it does not need to do a full set of A, B, C, D Instructions before repeating a letter.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <span class="emphasis">A car must comply with the currently active portion of its currently active Instruction at the first opportunity it can – thus, if a car is currently instructed to “Turn right at an intersection,” it must do so at the first opportunity it can.</span> Note in particular the difference between “Turn right at the first intersection you encounter” (which necessarily can <span class="emphasis">*only*</span> be done at the first intersection you encounter) and “Turn right at an intersection” (which can be done at the second intersection, if the first intersection only allows a left turn and thus the second intersection was in fact the soonest you could “turn right at an intersection”). Do not comply with an Instruction that would cause you to:
      </p>
      <ol class="alpha">
        <li>
          travel through 15 or more consecutive intersections without turning at any of them;
        </li>
        <li>
          reach a T intersection that you approach from the stem of the T (that is, a place where a cross-street extends to the left and to the right, but where you cannot proceed generally straight ahead) where you are not instructed to turn; or
        </li>
        <li>
          reach a dead end where you cannot proceed without turning around.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        If any of a, b, or c happens, you are off-course due to selecting an incorrect Instruction or performing an incorrect action, either in your current round or possibly an earlier round.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        The term “Xth” takes the appropriate suffix for whatever number X is. For example, if instructed “Turn right at Xth intersection,” and X is 1, the Instruction means “Turn right at 1st intersection,” despite the “th” in the Instruction. An intersection is a place where a car could proceed in more than one direction without making a U-turn – such as left or forward; or left or right; or left or right or forward; among other combinations. A simple bend or angle in a roadway where a car does not have a choice of 2 or more alternative paths is not an intersection, even if it is 90 degrees and/or even if the street name changes in the bend or angle. If a street to the right and to the left both meet the street you are on at essentially the same place (such as within about a car length), consider that area to be a single intersection even if the streets do not line up precisely. A single street divided by a median remains a single street, even if it appears as two blue lines on Google Maps. (This information is all intended to be helpful only – the situations you encounter should never be unclear or subject to reasonable debate.)
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        A “cross-street” is a Street View-accessible street (which may be (a) named or unnamed and/or (b) a traditional street or a driveway) at an intersection that extends to your left, to your right, or both, relative to your direction of travel. While some people, outside the event, may make a distinction between “cross-street” (all the way across) and “side-street” (one side only), for purposes of this event and simplicity of notation the term “cross-street” encompasses both types streets a car might turn onto.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Each car carries a scratchpad that is blank except for things the driver is instructed to add to it. Individual letters are always added to the scratchpad in order. If a scratchpad has 4 letters and you add another, that new letter is the 5th letter on the scratchpad.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Finally, and importantly, <span class="emphasis">you may find it useful to read through all of the numbered Instructions below before proceeding, and/or if you find yourself using brute force to examine excessively branching paths.</span> There is only one way to complete the course while following all Instructions, and in some cases, especially in the second half of the event, the correct path cannot be deduced by considering only the current round of Instructions -- some degree of looking ahead to later Instructions is required. While determining the correct route efficiently will require careful logic, nothing is intended to be unclear, ambiguous, or a language trick -- interpret things in the most natural way possible.
      </p>
    </li>

    Happy Motoring!
