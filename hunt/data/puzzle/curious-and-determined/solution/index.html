<p>The puzzle is broken up into three sections to indicate solving order. In the <strong>First</strong> section, you see 26 clues. Each clue is both very easy to solve, and also very strangely worded. The answers to the clues are also in alphabetical order.</p>

<p>To solve this part:</p>
<p><ol>
	<li>Answer the clues.</li>
	<li>Notice that each answer can be associated with 1, 2 or 3 colors. Further notice that these colors are in the set of RED, ORANGE, YELLOW, GREEN, BLUE, WHITE. (As hinted at in the flavor &#8220;six kinds of shady&#8221;.)</li>
	<li>Notice that each clue has been worded to include a word or phrase that can be paired with NATO letter to form a common word, phrase or title. This is subtly hinted at in the flavor as well with &#8220;clear communication&#8221; and the acrostic of the final four words, &#8220;not always the objective.&#8221;</li>
	<li>Finally, map each of the 26 answers / color sets to one letter of the alphabet.</li></ol>

<p>The next step is to figure out why we&#8217;re using only those colors. Those six colors appear together as a set in one very specific place: the six sides of a <strong>Rubik&#8217;s Cube</strong>. This is also hinted in the title, which is a reference to a quote by Ernö Rubik that&#8217;s quite applicable here: &#8220;If you are curious, you'll find the puzzles around you. If you are determined, you will solve them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Specifically, each color set from our table above aligns with the color arrangement of one cubelet on a Rubik&#8217;s Cube. With the association of letters to color sets, we can now associate each cubelet (of which there are 26, as the center of Rubik&#8217;s Cube isn&#8217;t visible) with a different letter of the alphabet. To do this, you can find a cube and write on it, or you can get creative with Google Sheets.</p>

<section class="display"><img src="images/0.png" width="400"></section>

<p>On to the second section, titled <strong>Then</strong>. Some of these clues are more ambiguous than others. Each answer is a word you can find on the cube, after one 90° rotation. (Hinted at by &#8220;14 moves away&#8221; in the flavor.) The answers and turns are indicated here. Turns are valid for a cube that has yellow in front (F) and orange on the left (L).</p>

<tr><td>Runs</td><td>JOGS</td><td>L</td></tr>
<tr><td>Turban wearer</td><td>SIKH</td><td>U</td></tr>
<tr><td>Simpsons character</td><td>BURNS</td><td>B&apos;</td></tr>

<p>At this point, the cube should be arranged in a pleasant snake-like pattern (in Cube parlance, this design is called the Anaconda), like so:</p>
<section class="display"><img src="images/cube1.png" height="350"><img src="images/cube2.png" height="350"></section>

<p>Parsing the letters on this path, using the enumeration for assistance, you can read:</p>

<p><strong>X IS ART BY WHOM</strong></p>

<p><strong>X</strong> is attached to the cubelet colored <strong>orange and yellow</strong>. The final bit of flavor asks you to find &#8220;the shady culprit&#8217;s full name.&#8221; <em><u>Orange and Yellow</u></em> is the title of a well-known painting by the famous abstract artist <span class="answer">MARK ROTHKO</span>, which is the answer.</p>

<div class="author-note">
    <h2>Author&#8217;s Notes</h2>
	<p>My original plan for this puzzle was to spell out the letters in ROTHKO using cubelets as pixels. Not many letters can be spelled with just a 3x3 pixel grid, but r (lowercase), O, T, H, and K pretty safely can. I loved how the block colors of a Rubik&#8217;s Cube matched the aesthetics of Rothko&#8217;s art. (Not to mention their names aren&#8217;t too far off.) But the answer we needed was MARK ROTHKO, and solving to just ROTHKO would have been inelegant.</p>

	<p>That&#8217;s when I started digging into Rubik&#8217;s patterns and thinking about the convenience of mapping all letters of the alphabet onto the 26 cubelets on a Cube. I was really pleased to compose the isogrammic message GUY WHO PAINTED X, but I couldn&#8217;t find a pattern that supported a 14-character message. So I settled for the Anaconda pattern above, and shrunk the message to fit.</p>

	<p>I feel extremely lucky my first attempt to map letters to cubelets more or less worked without needing much revision. I started by trying to use up the rarer letters in the first few words (J, G, K, B), and then, with every new turn, looking to see if a word was already there, and if not, adding letters until one showed up. I only had 2 vowels at my disposal (the others being in the main message), so I had to be judicious about assigning them. I made a point of using as much of the alphabet in part 2 as possible, as a way to &#8220;justify&#8221; having asked you to assign every letter to a cubelet, and I&#8217;m happy to report that Z is the only one not employed in part 2.</p>

	<p>Part 1 was a real joy to write. I knew this was going to work out when I found the association between tango -&gt; cell block -&gt; Shawshank Redemption -&gt; Red.</p>
