<p>Each clue in the first set clues the name of a puzzle from a previous Mystery Hunt that involved a crossword with an entry at 56 Across.
(Other such entries from past puzzles are MAE, HAS, and AMIGOS.)</p>

<p>Each clue in the second set clues a (usually fanciful) term that is one of those 56 Across entries with a letter added at the start and end;
these terms are in alphabetical order. Matching these up we have (in the first-set order):</p>

<p>The added letters at the start and end spell out two clues employing Roman numerals:</p>

<table>
<tr><th>Clue</th><th>Answer</th><th>Explanation</th></tr>
<tr><td>OMAR OF II IS A FAMILY</td><td>SY</td><td>Omar Sy was in the movie <em>Two is a Family</em>.</td></tr>
<tr><td>TOMOMI OF AKBXLVIII</td><td>ITANO</td><td>Tomomi Itano was in the band AKB48.</td></tr>

<p>The "specific location" is 56 Across, which in old Italy (that is, in Roman numerals) would be LVI ACROSS.</p>
<p>Removing the "heart" (middle letter) and separating these two people with it gives:</p>
<p>SY + LVIA[ ]ROSS + ITANO</p>
<p>so the answer is <span class="answer">SYLVIA ROSSITANO</span>.</p>
