<p>As hinted by the title and the flavortext, this puzzle is about minor league baseball teams. Specifically, each diagram represents one of the eleven divisions of Minor League Baseball.</p>
<p>Circles drawn in the same non-black color in different diagrams represent the same description and black circles each represent one of the unique descriptions.</p>
<p>(For example, the only circle type that appears six times is green solid, so it must represent "Geographical name contains two capital letters".)</p>
<p>Determine which division is represented by each diagram and where the teams are located in that division's diagram, then use the jersey number as an index into that team's nickname.</p>
<p>Those letters, taken in diagram order, spell DASH'S PARENT, a reference to the High-A East team the Winston-Salem Dash, whose parent team is the <span class="answer">WHITE SOX.</span></p>
