<p>The first picture is of Seth MacFarlane (creator of <em>The Orville</em>) in <em>Star Trek</em>, highlighted and obscured by a question mark.</p>
<p>Besides the story of transmissions being encrypted, the title and flavortext also try several times to suggest that transmissions are happening again, similar to some earlier time but not exactly the same.  ("Altered", "again", "seen these before".) </p>  
<p>The main set of pictures is <em>Star Trek</em> screenshots.  Their order is not identifiable, so it should be concluded that this is the extraction order.</p>
<p>With each picture is a string of letters, which is a Playfair encryption (Flavor mentions "Play … Fair").  If you decrypt with the title of the <em>Star Trek</em> episode, you get a question asking what episode of X has a certain plot, and the plot actually describes the same <em>Star Trek</em> episode.  However, it also describes an episode of <em>The Orville</em>.</p>
<p>Find the <em>Orville</em> episode for each <em>Star Trek</em> episode.  There have been 26 episodes of <em>The Orville</em>, so each episode translates to a letter.  Further flavortext clues relevant to extraction:</p>
<table>
<tr><th>Flavortext</th><th>Meaning</th></tr>
<tr><td>The dates don't matter.</td><td>Stardates and airdates are not part of the puzzle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>or even whether it was spring or summer.</td><td>When extracting via <em>Orville</em> episode, the season does not matter...</td></tr>
<tr><td>Just get an absolute position.</td><td>… just the absolute position of the episode within the entire run.</td></tr>

<p>Reading off those letters in the order of the pictures provided will spell FORD CALLED IT BUNK, to which the answer is <span class="answer">HISTORY</span>.</p>

    <h2>Author's Notes</h2>
    <p>I'm a fan of <em>Star Trek</em>.  And I'm a fan of <em>The Orville</em>, which I feel is the heir of episodic <em>Trek</em>-like stories.  (Current live-action <em>Trek</em> having moved to season-long storytelling.)  And although I think <em>The Orville</em> stands on its own, to someone who knows all the <em>Star Trek</em> plots, I couldn't help but notice parallels when I watch <em>The Orville</em>.  I don't fault them; after such a long history, many <em>Star Trek</em> plots are simply common sci-fi tropes at this point, and they're weaving interesting and engaging stories out of those common threads.</p>
    <p>I was initially thinking there would be some kind of title indexing for a final extraction, but got a good boost when I noticed that there have been exactly 26 episodes of <em>The Orville</em>, obviously mapping to the alphabet.  Then came some worry – just for a puzzle-construction perspective – that <em>The Orville</em> would start season 3 during the constructing year, which would throw off those numbers!  Fortunately for the puzzle, if frustrating for fans, it was announced in September that season 3 would come in March, after the Hunt.</p>
    <p>This puzzle went through more format changes than most of my puzzles, as we tried to find the right presentation to wrap around the intended revelation.  Some drafts clued <em>The Orville</em> not (only) with a picture of Seth MacFarlane in <em>Enterprise</em>, but tried cluing it with screen captures from ENT: "First Flight" and either TNG: "Brothers" or DSC: "Brother".  Some provided the plot connections between the two series pictorially, or with a word bank.  All of these presentations were too confusing, and then we hit upon the one used here, which depends on first identifying the <em>Star Trek</em> episode pictured.</p>
