<p>
  First start by noting that the locations (all of which are fake cities) have an
  acrostic: <i>CATEGORY CLUES PICS ENUMERATION</i>.
</p>

<p>
  Each category has been replaced with a certain number of stars. In presentation order,
  the pics are: <i>EWE SWAN HUNT RED PURSE ENT GO LIN WAR DINN DECK SING AWL TEX</i>.
</p>

<p>Phonetically, this produces "<i>Use 100% goal in word indexing all text</i>."</p>

<p>
  Determine the 100% goal. Each is an even number of digits, and each bigram is a number
  from 1 to 50. Index into the title and description combined to get a series of clues.
  Each can be answered with a phrase with the initials P.S. (which is also a second
  thought).
