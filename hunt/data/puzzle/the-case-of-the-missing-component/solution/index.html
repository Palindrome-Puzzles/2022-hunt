<p>“The Chief Inspector” referred to in the flavortext is Endeavor Morse. Each of the answers contains a sequence of Ks and Os which can be interpreted as letters in Morse Code, using Ks as dashes and Os as dots. The flavortext also alludes to something feline going on, with “pussyfooting” and the frequent “purr” sounds. Each answer clues a book in the <i>The Cat Who...</i> mystery series. The title cat is KOKO, which, considered as a Morse “C”, confirms the dash-dot usage.</p>

<p>Each answer also clues a specific title in that series, which has a canonical ordering. This provides an ordering for the Morse letters, spelling the answer phrase <span class="answer">A CRYING SHAMUS</span>.</p>
