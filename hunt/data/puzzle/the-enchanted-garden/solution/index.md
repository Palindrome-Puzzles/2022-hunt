The Latin names for four weeds can be found in the unnumbered rows, reading left to right row by row but not necessarily consecutively:

- AJUGA REPTANS (Bugleweed)
- CONVOLVULUS ARVENSIS (Bindweed)
- AMBROSIA ARTEMISIIFOLIA (Ragweed)
- PHYTOLACCA AMERICANA (Pokeweed)

Clearing these away leaves a list of ten ingredients:

- VODKA
- BLUE
- SPAIN
- SENATE
- GOLD
- SILVER
- HOUSE
- PORTUGAL
- RED
- OJ

Combining the first of these with the last, the second with the second to last, and so on, gives you five items:

- SCREWDRIVER
- PURPLE
- IBERIA
- CONGRESS
- ELECTRUM

The first letters of these spell the answer to this puzzle, <span class="answer">SPICE</span>.
