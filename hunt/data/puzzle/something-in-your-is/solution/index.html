<p>This puzzle references the film <i>Midnight Madness</i> (which is about five color-coded teams solving a drive-around puzzle hunt). Specifically, for the first clue:</p>

<div class="clue_container clue">The Sea is reversed. S.S. Itari is mixed up and blind. 38-22-23 / 56-10-11</div>

<p>the first two sentences are correctly solved by all teams as &quot;See the stars,&quot; but all the teams except the blue team (which has a computer that can solve any puzzle) misinterpret what that means. Three of the colors in each block (red, yellow, and green) are colors of teams that make these misinterpretations. The first (&quot;First Priority&quot;) line in each block is not in any team color, and refers to one of the subsequent clues in the hunt; the blocks can then be ordered as per the order of those clues. Then:</p>

<p><span class="red_alert">Red</span> (sorority team, who incorrectly go to the &quot;Starlight Disco&quot;): Each entry contains clues for two answers; one answer contains an anagram of DISCO, and in its place the other answer contains a single letter. In order, these letters spell BOULEVARD.</p>

<p><span class="yellow_alert">Yellow</span> (protagonist team, who incorrectly try to interpret maps of stars&apos; homes): Each entry mentions three actors, and indicates whether they are dotty, loopy, or neither. In each case, those three were in a film which contains either a number (in Arabic numerals) or a direction. In order, these numerals (followed by . for &quot;dotty&quot; or ° for &quot;loopy&quot;) and directions form latitude and longitude coordinates for the HOLLYWOOD sign.</p>

<p><span class="green_alert">Green</span> (football team team, who incorrectly go to the wax museum): Each entry tells you to add n * |R letter - Y letter| (for some n) &quot;figures&quot; to a running total. For some, these are figures of a specified member of the LA Rams with a retired number; for some, you are told it &quot;doesn&apos;t matter.&quot; Those for which it doesn&apos;t matter are in the positions corresponding to where BOULEVARD and HOLLYWOOD have the same letter; if we take |R letter – Y letter| (call this Δ for short) to be the difference in corresponding letters between BOULEVARD and HOLLYWOOD, Δ is 0 in those places, explaining why it doesn&apos;t matter. If we take the &quot;figure&quot; for each Ram to be his retired number, the sum of all the nΔ * # values is 6533.</p>

<p>The details are given in the chart below:</p>

<p>The remaining misguided team in the film is the white (debate club) team, who think they need to look at the stars on Hollywood Boulevard. The answer is the person, among the ten people with a star at 6533 Hollywood Boulevard, whose name appears (as shown) in two lines: <span class="answer">ELIZABETH MONTGOMERY</span>.</p>
