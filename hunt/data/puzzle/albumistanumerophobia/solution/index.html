<p>The first set of 16 tables contains data for independent variables, and the second set contains data for dependent variables. Pairing one table from each set produces a common expression or song lyric.  For example, pairing “Miles per hour” from the independent variables with “Nuclear by-products” from the dependent variables clues “Haste makes waste."</p>

<p>Once the variables are paired, sort them by the first year of the Independent variable (2000-2015) and compute the correlation.  The absolute values of the correlations, rounded to two digits, all fall between 65 and 90, corresponding to ASCII codes of the letters A through Z.  Converting to letters gives the solution.</p>

    <h2>Authors' Notes</h2>
    <p>This is a spiritual sequel to BAPHL 19’s Arrr-Squared (see <a href="http://www.baphl.org/19/pdfs/1-SABOTAGE-PIRATES-ACUTE.pdf">www.baphl.org/19/pdfs/1-SABOTAGE-PIRATES-ACUTE.pdf</a>), a puzzle we thought deserved a Hunt followup. Much to our surprise, it was possible to make datasets such that some of the correlations had only two significant digits (e.g., the correlation of [10, 20, 30, 40] and [50, 51, 64, and 57] is exactly 0.68), and the others could be brought arbitrarily close. However, this proved too amenable to brute-forcing, so we opted for a more approximate approach.</p>
