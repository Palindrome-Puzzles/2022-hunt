  Once the pieces are cut out, assembling them into the labyrinth proceeds in two stages:

<h3>Squares assembled</h3>
<p>
  The half-squares are assembled in pairs into squares, by assembling each mintotaur (figure with bull horns and human feet) so the "horns" clue answer is the "feet" clue answer with MOO or LOW added. The set of squares is then:

<h3>Squares combined</h3>
<p>
  The squares are then assembled into a 4x4 square, matched up by paths. The path patterns on the edge of the 1x1 squares are shown above (1 = path present, 0 = path absent, in clockwise order). We can deduce the assembly pattern as follows:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      0010 matches with 0100, but no 1x1 has 0100 on any edge, so all 0010s must occur on the edge of the 4x4. Thus, the only 8 1x1s that can form part of the center 2x2 are (color coded for how they will be used in parts (2) and (3)):

      ST and LA only have one edge apiece (0001) that matches anything else in this set (the 1000 of THEN, HALED, and VASE), so if either one occurs in the central 2x2, they both have to, next to each other, touching two of THEN, HALED, and VASE at their 0001 edges; but then a 0110 of LA would be touching a 1001 of ST, which is impossible. Thus, ST and LA are not in the central 2x2.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Also, none of THEN, HALED, and VASE can touch each other, so if there is more than one of these in the central 2x2 there would have to be two, catercorner, touching two of TED, BOUT, and Theseus; however, TED cannot touch  VASE, BOUT cannot touch THEN, and Theseus cannot touch HALED, so this is impossible. So there cannot be more than one of THEN, HALED, and VASE in the central 2x2, so that 2x2 must consist of one of these along with all of TED, BOUT, and Theseus. Of the six options for neighbors of THEN, HALED, and VASE only one allows the remaining one of TED, Theseus, and BOUT to be placed (orientations are given in parentheses):

      The B-C edge is now 1001-1001, and the L-K edge is now 0110-0110, so HOLLY (<) must be in C and CAL (v) must be in K. Also, E and I must contain the only two remaining 1x1s with a 1111 edge, FER and WILY. Putting FER (<) in I and WILY (^) in E leaves no possibilities for F and H. Putting FER (v) in E and WILY (>) in I forces F to be HALED (v) and H to be VASE (^). Up to rotation, we now have:

      Finally, CHER's 1110 and 0001 are not adjacent, so it cannot go in J or G and must go in D as CHER (>), RING's 1110 is clockwise from its 0001, so it cannot go in J and must go in G as RING (v), and finally by elimination the Damsel must go in J as Damsel (^). As per the instructions, the Damsel needs to be upright; here, since she already is upright, we do not need to rotate the 4x4 further. The final, assembled 4x4 is:

  We can now trace a path from Theseus, through all the minotaurs, to the damsel and out of the labyrinth. This path crosses the Latin word VIR on leaving Theseus, and for everyone else crosses a cluster of one or two consonants on arriving and a vowel on leaving; putting these consonants and vowels together, in path order, we have the following:
