<p>The puzzle combines Egyptian hieroglyphics and three of the rounds from the game show Only Connect. Each of the hieroglyphic symbols in the 18 tiles without enumerations is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transliteration_of_Ancient_Egyptian#Uniliteral_signs" target="_blank">uniliteral sign</a>, corresponding to one phoneme in the Egyptian language. The first step is to interpret the hieroglyphs phonetically:</p>

<p> The vowels are missing from these, as is generally the case in hieroglyphs and in Only Connect round 4. When those vowels are re-populated, the cells of the grid (including those that contain enumeration blanks) need to be grouped into 4s as in Only Connect round 3. Finally, each set is an ordered list whose last element (which fits with one of the enumerations) must be found, as in Only Connect round 2. The categories are:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Actors who played the Doctor in <i>Doctor Who</i> (Baker, McCoy, McGann, <b>Eccleston</b>)</li>
    <li>Elements of the periodic table (boron, carbon, nitrogen, <b>oxygen</b>)</li>
    <li>The Mohs scale of hardness (quartz, topaz, corundum, <b>diamond</b>)</li>
    <li><i>Discworld</i> novels (<i>Sourcery</i>, <i>Wyrd Sisters</i>, <i>Pyramids</i>, <b><i>Guards! Guards!</i></b>)</li>
    <li>Presidents of Egypt (Nasser, Sadat, Mubarak, <b>Morsi</b>)</li>
    <li>1st-gen Pokémon (Pikachu, Raichu, Sandshrew, <b>Sandslash</b>)</li>

<p>Note that the cells are listed alphabetically in the grid.</p>

<p>Fans of Only Connect will note that each of the enumerations is listed with one of the six hieroglyphs used by that show, which are always presented in this configuration:</p>
<table class="only-connect large-glyphs centered">
    <tr>
        <td>𓇌</td>
        <td>𓃭</td>
        <td>𓎛</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>𓆑</td>
        <td>𓈗</td>
        <td>𓂀</td>
    </tr>
<table>

<p>Each of the enumerated answers has one letter in a cartouche, and each is associated with a number in its list (e.g. oxygen is the 8th element). The cartouche has one # for one-digit numbers and two #s for two-digit numbers. The answers can be arranged by their associated hieroglyph like so:</p>
<table class="centered grid">
    <tr>
        <td><pre>G[U8]ARDS GUARDS</pre></td>
        <td><pre>O[X8]YGEN</pre></td>
        <td><pre>ECCLEST[O9]N</pre></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><pre>[M5]ORSI</pre></td>
        <td><pre>SAN[D28]SLASH</pre></td>
        <td><pre>DIAMON[D10]</pre></td>
    </tr>
<table>

<p>Most common hieroglyphs are found in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gardiner%27s_sign_list" target="_blank">Gardiner’s Sign List</a>, a canonical list of common signs compiled by Alan Gardiner, hinted at by “gardener” in the flavor text. The list assigns each hieroglyph a letter-number combination. We can use the letter-number combinations above to find the corresponding hieroglyphs:</p>
<table class="centered grid">
    <tr>
        <td><span class="large-glyphs">𓌼</span><pre>[U8]</pre></td>
        <td><span class="large-glyphs">𓏙</span><pre>[X8]</pre></td>

        <td><span class="large-glyphs">𓂀</span><pre>[D10]</pre></td>
    </tr>

<p>The hieroglyphs look like the letters of <span class="answer">CAT FUR</span>, the answer to the puzzle (and also, as the flavor text alludes to, what is missing from a sphynx cat).</p>

    <h2>Author's Note</h2>
    <p>I've been thinking of Mystery Hunt 2022, in a way, as Palindrome's love letter to the written word, and this puzzle brings it back to the very beginning. It came out of the felicitous observation that (A) Only Connect prominently uses hieroglyphs and (B) one of its main game mechanics is writing without vowels, which Egyptian hieroglyphics also does.</p>
    <p>The puzzle was partly inspired by the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/169989636491817" target="_blank">Only Connect questions</a> Facebook group, where people post Only Connect challenges which occasionally include combo walls that combine the elements of multiple rounds.</p>
    <p>Finding six sets of four that led to appropriate letter-number combinations was very constrained, in particular because Egyptian hieroglyphics did not have native phonetic representations for a lot of English sounds -- meaning we couldn't use clues with any Fs, Vs, or Ls.</p>
    <p>The fact that the Eye of Horus corresponds to itself in the extraction was a pleasant coincidence.</p>
    <p>Finally, a shout out to the YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiqCdyT8eKRVOLvUeBCZ8cg" target="_blank">Voices of Ancient Egypt</a> which was a great resource for learning what sounds all the symbols make and how they fit together.</p>
