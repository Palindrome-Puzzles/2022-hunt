<p>The storied Heavenly Bodice is constructed from fabric prepared according to the following directives, passed down since time immemorial:</p>

<ol>
	<li value="1">Correctly assemble the eight intermixed, pre-patterned 5x5 fabric squares (once each) into the two 10x10 square racks (the 5x5 squares may be rotated but not flipped, and thick lines may overlap other adjacent thick lines in whole or in part, but are not required to do so -- that is, thick lines may overlap thick or thin lines, and vice versa; where two thick lines overlap, they appear as a single thick line; also, there are no stray thick lines inside of any region -- every thick line is part of a region's outer boundary);<br></li>
<li value="2">Decorate each assembled 10x10 fabric with Heavenly Stars, placing exactly 2 in each row, column, and outlined region (but no more than one per small square, and starred squares cannot touch, not even diagonally);<br></li>
<li value="3">Further decorate each assembled and starred 10x10 fabric by placing a single letter in, or blacking out, each 1x1 square such that:
<ol type="a">
	<li value="a">the rows, reading across, and columns, reading down -- in order -- answer the instructed clues when skipping over (that is, ignoring) the black squares, and</li>
	<li value="b">the black squares do not form a 2x2 black square anywhere (but otherwise may touch or appear in any configuration).</li></ol>
</ol>
