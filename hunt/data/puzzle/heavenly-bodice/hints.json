[[0.0, ["beginning"], "Start by putting together the 8 5x5 squares to form two 10x10 squares that will be grids for a type of logic puzzle called Star Battle. To be valid Star Battle puzzles, the grids must have exactly 10 regions each, and each region must contain at least 3 squares. There is only one way to do this."], [10.0, ["after grids assembled"], "Once the grids are assembled, solve them as Star Battle grids -- 2 stars in each row, columns, and region. There are Star Battle solvers available online, and you should feel free to use them."], [20.0, ["after star battles solved"], "After solving the Star Battles (or during, with people working in parallel), complete the 2 crosswords. Words in the crosswords are entered in order, but can skip over squares (skipped squares get blackened in). Thus, the word START might be entered as -S-TA-R--T (with the dashes here representing black squares in the grid)."], [30.0, ["help with crossword"], "Note that every letter in each crossword is part of both an across entry and a down entry. So, for example, in grid 1 there is only one W going across, in WASTE, and one W going down, in AWAY. So, the square in which those entries cross must contain a W. Many letters can be placed immediately this way, and others can then be worked out logically."], [100.0, ["extraction"], "For each grid, take the squares indicated by the stars in the corresponding Star Battle. This will spell out your answer words (with some black squares also being identified as spaces before, between, and after the answer words)."]]
