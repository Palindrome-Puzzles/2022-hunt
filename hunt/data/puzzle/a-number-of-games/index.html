    <p class="flavor">It's playtime! Rita and her classmate Lefty have been playing a lot of games lately. So much, in
        fact, that they are quite familiar with the Winning Ways of all the games they play.</p>
    <div>
        <p>Game rules:</p>
        <p>In the games they play, there are two players who alternate making moves. The first time that a player cannot
            make a move on their turn, that player loses.</p>
        <p>Col: Each player, on their turn, paints one region of the map their color (b<u>L</u>ue for Lefty, or <u>R</u>ed
            for Rita). Adjacent regions may not share a color.</p>
        <p>Domineering: Lefty moves by placing a vertical $2 \times 1$ domino onto two empty squares of the grid. Rita
            does the same thing with horizontal $1 \times 2$ dominos.</p>
        <p>Hackenbush: Lefty moves by deleting any b<u>L</u>ue edge, together with any edges that are no longer
            connected to the ground. Rita does the same thing with <u>R</u>ed edges.</p>
        <p>Toads and Frogs: On a $1\times n$ strip of squares are Lefty's toads (facing right) and Rita's frogs (facing
            left). On a player's turn, one of their animals will move forward one space into an empty square, or hop
            over one opposing animal into an empty square.</p>
    </div>

        <p>From playing the games so much, they have learned a way to give values to their game positions, and to
            compare those values against each other. Here are some of their game theories:</p>
        <p><b>If Lefty always has a strategy that will win, no matter who goes first, then the game has a positive
            value.</b> For example, in this Domineering game, Lefty can make one move but Rita cannot make any. It has a
            positive value. Specifically, it has a value of $1$, which roughly represents that it gives an advantage of
            1 move to Lefty. (Games with more complicated shapes can have non-integer values, though!)</p>

            </div>
        </div>
        <p><b>If Rita always has a strategy that will win, no matter who goes first, then the game has a negative
            value.</b> For example, this Domineering game, where Rita can make a single move instead of Lefty, has a
            negative value. Specifically, it has a value of $-2$, which roughly represents a 2-move advantage for Rita.
            Notice how if she plays it well, she can make 2 moves in this space.</p>

            </div>
        </div>
        <p><b>If it matters who goes first, then the game is neither positive nor negative:</b></p>
        <p><b>If the second player always has a strategy to win, then the game's value is $0$.</b> For example, in this
            Col game, whoever goes first can color one of the cells, then the second player colors the other cell, and
            the first player is unable to move.</p>

            </div>
        </div>
        <p><b>If the first player always has a strategy to win, then we have a value which is not positive, negative, or
            zero, and so cannot be represented as a traditional number.</b> An example is this Domineering game, where
            either player can move just once:</p>
        <div class="flex-group">
            <div class="image-container">

            </div>
        </div>
        <p><b>Games can be added together, which sums their values.</b> Imagine you have two or more games next to each
            other. Two players alternate making moves, which they can choose to do in any of those games. The player who
            first cannot make a move in the combined game, i.e. cannot find a move to make in any of the individual
            games, loses. For example, if we add two copies of this L-shaped Domineering game to this 1-move (and value
            $1$) Hackenbush game, we get a game with the value $0$: it is a second-player win. (The first two moves, in
            whichever order, will be in the corners of the two Ls, leaving one move available for each player, and
            whoever started first will run out of moves first.) This shows that the value of that L-shaped Domineering
            game is $-\frac{1}{2}$.</p>

            </div>
        </div>
        <p><b>Reversing a game, or taking its negative (and the negative of its value), is done by taking the game in
            which the moves available to the two players have been switched.</b> For Domineering, reversing a game can
            be done by rotating it 90&deg;. For Col and Hackenbush, switch the colors. For Frogs and Toads, take the
            mirror image, and ignore the art difference between frogs and toads.</p>
        <p><b>In general, games can be compared,</b> so that we can say which one (and its value) is greater or lower.
            Often, the individual values of two games will tell you numerically which is greater; for instance, a game
            whose value is $2$ is greater than a game with a value of $1$. In general, $G_1> G_2$ means that $G_1+
            (-G_2)$ is positive (that is, Lefty wins). But not all pairs of games can be successfully compared. If $G_1+
            (-G_2)$ is a game which the first player always has a strategy to win, then we can't say that $G_1$ is
            greater, and it's not lower either. You just have a pair of games that are not comparable. For example,
            let's look at a comparison between this 1-move Hackenbush game and this L-shaped Domineering game:</p>
        <div class="flex-group">
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="images/number-of-games-puz-06.png" class="stretch" alt="Hackenbush of a single red branch next to Domineering board, an L-tetromino of width 3 and height 2">
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>To judge this, let's play the $G_{1}+ (-G_{2})$ game: </p>
        <div class="flex-group">
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="images/number-of-games-puz-07.png" class="stretch" alt="Hackenbush of a single red branch next to Domineering board, an L-tetromino of width 2 and height 3">
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>Lefty can only move in the Domineering game, and his best move is in the corner (otherwise he leaves a move
            for Rita). If he goes first, Rita is left with a move in the Hackenbush game, which ends the game. If Rita
            goes first, she also starts in Domineering, leaving a move for Lefty there, and she still finishes the game
            with the Hackenbush move. Rita wins in both scenarios, and so $G_1+ (-G_2)$ is negative. $G_1+ (-G_2) < 0$ ,
            which means that $G_1 < G_2$. And this fits with our independent knowledge of their numerical values: $G_1 =
            -1 < -\frac{1}{2} = G_2$.</p>

        <p>Now that you have learned so much about Lefty and Rita's games, their classmate Maz is giving you a
            challenge. He has made a maze for you to follow. Using knowledge of the values of games, you need to
            navigate the grid below, starting with a green pen color, moving up along the green start arrow. </p>
        <img src="images/number-of-games-puz-09.png" class="img-l"
             alt="a hexagonal maze, with various games corresponding to each row of the grid">
        <p>Maze rules:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Each cell can be identified by a pair of coordinates, one (with blue arrows) on the left and upper left
                edges of the grid, and one (with red arrows) on the right and upper right edges of the grid. Each
                coordinate has a game position associated with it.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p>If you enter a cell that has only one other exit, take that exit automatically and move towards the
                center of the next hex. Otherwise, you will try to compare the games at the two coordinates, to see
                which (if any) is bigger. (Except as amended by rule 5 below.)</p>
            </li>
            <li><p>What direction do you turn? Which game is bigger? That is, if the game at the left coordinate is
                greater, turn left; if the game at the right coordinate is greater, turn right. If neither left nor
                right is the answer, then do not move: stay in place -- and change to a different pen color.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Your turn should be as small as possible. That is, if you are supposed to be turning left or right,
                    and there is an exit at a 60&deg; turn in that direction, make the 60&deg; turn. You will only make
                    a 120&deg; turn if the 60&deg; turn is blocked by a black wall.</p>

            </li>
            <li><p>If you need to determine a turning direction for a cell where you've already compared the two games,
                naturally the calculation based on the coordinates wouldn't change. To keep things fresh, if you repeat
                a cell, take the next game from the "games shelf" below, and add it to the (original) left coordinate
                for this comparison. (That addition is not permanent, but only for the purposes of this single
                comparison.)</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>No comparison will be between two games of exactly the same value.</p>

    <hr>
    <div>
        <p>"Games shelf": Each time you are doing a comparison in a cell you've done before, take the next game from
            this list, in order, and add it to the game from the (original) left coordinate. Each game will be taken
            down from the shelf only once.</p>
