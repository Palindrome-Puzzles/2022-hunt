  For each plot description, we can identify the movie and fill in the blank with an
  answer that fits the enumeration given in the top row, the highlighted cells spell out
  clue phrase "ID WINNERS BY MOVIE YEAR AND GENRE". This refers to the Bulwer Lytton
  Fiction Contest, as clued by title "Bad Beginnings" and flavor text "It was a dark and
  stormy night...". Bulwer Lytton Fiction Contest each year selects winners for the
  "opening sentences to the worst of all possible novels" in various genres. If we read
  the entries in corresponding year and genre, we can find another answer that will also
  work (more or less), and that will fit the enumeration given in the bottom row. This
  second set of highlighted cells spell out the answer:
  <span class="answer">WRITE STORY OF A GASHLYCRUMB TINY</span>.

        Bill swore the affair had ended, but Louise knew he was lying, after discovering
        Tupperware containers under the seat of his car, which were not the off-brand
        containers that she bought to save money, but authentic, burpable, lidded
        Tupperware; and she knew he would see that woman again, because unlike the flimsy,
        fake containers that should always be recycled responsibly, real Tupperware must
        be returned to its rightful owner.

        The Mushroom Men of Knarf were silently advancing on the unsuspecting earthlings,
        and their thin milky blood ran colder when they smelled spores from fungal toenail
        infections rising from many of the invaders’ feet, for to them it was a wondrous
        and shocking scent of kinship, homeland, and asexual reproduction.
