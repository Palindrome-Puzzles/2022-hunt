<p>The many references to tasks and crewmates throughout the passages combined with the suspicious looking bookmarks (along with the words "suspicious" and "game" in the flavor text) hint at the fact that this puzzle is related to the popular task-completing deception game <i>Among Us.</i></p>
<p>Each description contains a bolded crossword clue, the solutions to which are words that contain the letters U and S with exactly one letter in between. The first letter of the descriptions, read in the same order, spell out the clue phrase "ORDER LETTERS AMONG US". Taking this instruction literally (in typical Amelia Bedelia fashion), we can re-sort the images by using the letter that falls between the letters U and S in each solution (since the order letters are among US).</p>

<p>All of the images correspond to a task from <i>Among Us</i> with a single letter modified (ex. PICK UP TOWELS has been replaced with PICK UP VOWELS). After sorting by the letters among US (and using the missing letters as spaces), the modified letters spell "ACTOR WHO VOICED KUIIL". This combined with the blank space and the page number (which is actually the answer enumeration) gives the answer to the puzzle, <span class="answer">NOLTE</span>.</p>
