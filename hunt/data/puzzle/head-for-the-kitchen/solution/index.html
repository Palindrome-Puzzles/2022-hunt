<p>Each of the &quot;contestants&quot; is a member of the list of names of nonkosher birds in Deuteronomy 14:11-18, in the original Hebrew (as per the Masoretic Text); this list is very similar to, but not quite identical with, the list in Leviticus 11:13-19. This is why <i>all</i> the contestants are eventually disqualified for violating the &quot;Food Code&quot; — the kosher laws. (The &quot;Cooking with Locusts&quot; reference at the end refers to the fact that in both Leviticus and Deuteronomy, the list of nonkosher birds precedes a discussion of what insects, etc. may be eaten.) The five announcers giving the play-by-play correspond to the English names of the Five Books of Moses, both by initial letter and in other ways:</p>

<table>
<tr><th>Name</th><th>Book</th><th>Clues</th></tr>
<tr><td>Guy</td><td>Genesis</td><td>Says &quot;Let&apos;s get started,&quot; and describes first ingredients.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Emeril</td><td>Exodus</td><td>Makes many, many references to contestants coming out, emerging, etc.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Lidia</td><td>Leviticus</td><td>Is &quot;someone who handles the clerical stuff&quot; (&quot;Leviticus&quot; means &quot;Pertaining to the Levites&quot;), and had a list differing from Delia&apos;s.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Nigella</td><td>Numbers</td><td>Uses many, many numbers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Delia</td><td>Deuteronomy</td><td>Is &quot;to state the rules another time&quot; (&quot;Deuteronomy&quot; means &quot;Second law&quot;), and had a list differing from Lidia&apos;s.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>We see the last five contests of a single-elimination tournament that has already eliminated fifteen names; before each contest, Guy, Nigella, and Delia each indicate one of these.</p>
<ul>
<li>Guy gives the &quot;first ingredient&quot; (first letter) and says how many there are total; each letter is indicated by its name&apos;s original meaning.</li>
<li>Nigella gives, for a letter in a particular position (given by &quot;at &lt;position&gt;&quot;), what its numeric value is.</li>
<li>Delia indicates how the name is involved in some difference between Delia&apos;s and Lidia&apos;s lists.</li>
</ul>

<tr><td>1</td><td>first ingredient (of three) was hearts of <u>palm</u></td><td>kos (first letter of three is kaf = &quot;palm&quot;)</td><td>At 1 . . .

<tr><td>3</td><td>first ingredient (of five) . . . — an entire <u>hand</u> of bananas</td><td>yanshuf (first letter of five is yod = &quot;hand&quot;)</td><td>At 3, . . . the time Phileas Fogg had to travel through 360 degrees of longitude to win 20,000 pounds sterling . . . it&apos;s in its final form</td><td>shahaf (letter 3 is the final form of pe = 80; the time is 80 days)</td><td>one name on my list, which was five places later there than on Lidia&apos;s list</td><td>shalak (its position on the lists differs as described)</td></tr>

</table>

<p>The remaining elements of Delia&apos;s list are:</p>

<table>
<tr><th>Position</th><th>English Letter</th><th>Name</th><th>Spelling</th></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>A</td><td>nesher</td><td>nun-shin-resh</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>C</td><td>ozniyah</td><td>ayin-zayin-nun-yod-he</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>E</td><td>ayyah</td><td>aleph-yod-he</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>G</td><td>orev</td><td>ayin-resh-beth</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>K</td><td>netz</td><td>nun-final sadhe</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>R</td><td>hasidah</td><td>heth-samekh-yod-daleth-he</td></tr>
</table>

<p>We must then deduce who won and lost which of the final contests.</p>
<ul>
<li>1 was lost by netz (the only one with a &quot;final form&quot; letter). </li>
<li>2 was lost by nesher (the only one with five or more dots below its letters when vowel marks are written).</li>
<li>Thus 1 was won by ozniyah (the only remaining name containing the nun netz has) and 2 was won by hasidah (the only remaining name with more letters than nesher).</li>
<li>3 was lost by ozniyah (hasidah and ozniyah are the only two remaining names that have more syllables than another remaining name, and hasidah isn&apos;t in 3).</li>
<li>4 was won by ayyah and lost by hasidah (with yod-he in the former and yod-daleth-he in the latter).</li>
<li>Thus 3 was won by the only remaining name, orev.</li>
<li>Thus, 5 was ayyah versus orev, and orev (alphabetically later than ayyah) lost, and ayyah won.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also each contest&apos;s results are noted down by a different announcer. In order by biblical book, we thus have:</p>

<table>
<tr><th>Name</th><th>Contest number</th><th>Winner name</th><th>Winner letter</th><th>Loser name</th><th>Loser letter</th></tr>
<tr><td>Guy</td><td>5</td><td>ayyah</td><td>E</td><td>orev</td><td>G</td></tr>
<tr><td>Emeril</td><td>3</td><td>orev</td><td>G</td><td>ozniyah</td><td>C</td></tr>
<tr><td>Lidia</td><td>2</td><td>hasidah</td><td>R</td><td>nesher</td><td>A</td></tr>
<tr><td>Nigella</td><td>1</td><td>ozniyah</td><td>C</td><td>netz</td><td>K</td></tr>
<tr><td>Delia</td><td>4</td><td>ayyah</td><td>E</td><td>hasidah</td><td>R</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Reading these letter pairs in order, we get the answer <span class="answer">EGG CRACKER</span> (which each of these birds was at birth, thus demonstrating an important chef skill).</p>
