  <p>Tock shakes his head upon seeing the Ministers’ reports, then turns around and stares at the mural on the wall before staring back at the missing Hayden. “Of course each one is only seeing a bit of the problem. Perhaps if we put all their viewpoints together, we can see the whole picture.”</p>

<h2>Ministers' Locations</h2>
<p>Barker is standing in front of a computer, trying to calm an out-of-control printer.</p>
<p>Dewey is teaching a management class, holding their hands up in the air and grabbing onto some rope coming from the ceiling.</p>
<p>Hayden, given that she no longer currently has a library, is recording Dewey for later archival.</p>
<p>Lewis is currently yelling at Barker to stop, since her printer is disrupting his music.</p>
<p>The Rotch brothers are busy arguing over two plans of basically the same thing.</p>
