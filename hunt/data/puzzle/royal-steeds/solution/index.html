<p>Solvers must identify the Blue Bike station in each photograph, as well as answering the associated trivia question. Taking the indicated letters from the trivia questions yields the instruction: COLUMN HEADERS TENS ROW HEADERS ONES.</p>

<p>Solvers must also assemble the pentominos using the colored edges as a guide, yielding this grid:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img width="388" height="355" alt="An 11 by 11 grid with numbers running across the top row and left column, and a mix of letters and numbers in the remaining squares" src="images/assembled-grid-royalsteeds.png" /></p>

<p>Blue Bike station locations and numbers can be found on the <a href="https://member.bluebikes.com/map/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">System Map</a> at the <a href="https://www.bluebikes.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">Blue Bikes web page</a>. Each Blue Bike station has a number, consisting of a single letter followed by 5 digits. The first three digits are always 320. Using the grid above taking the tens and ones digits of the station numbers, in clue order yields the clue phrase: CAFE JUST NORTH OF C32025.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.bluebikes.com/system-data" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">System Data page</a> of the Blue Bikes site links to <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hubway-data/current_bluebikes_stations.csv" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">a spreadsheet</a> that gives locations and station numbers for all stations.

<h2>Author's Notes</h2>
<p>Aaron: With the Hunt gone remote, I wanted to write a puzzle that had the feel of a runaround: the sense of wandering around the Boston area and finding the familiar made strange, nigh puzzly. Overlaying a fantasy theme over the Boston Blue Bike system proved to be a wonderful way to do that. I had so much fun researching for this puzzle to find places in Boston that could be tied to fantasy elements. I hope it gave you the remote solvers a taste of the greater Boston area in all its batshit glory.</p>

<p>I want to mention a few things that didn't make the final puzzle: <a href="https://www.schon.com/public/dragon-dorch.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">A Dragon for Dorchester</a>, <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-fairy-shop-boston" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">The Fairy Shop in Back Bay</a>, <a href="https://www.oddthingsiveseen.com/2015/09/villains-end-grave-of-william-stoughton.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">William Stoughton's tomb<a>, and the <a href="https://www.salem.org/listing/bewitched-statue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">Bewitched Statue in Salem</a>. They were for various technical reasons unclueable, but they definitely contributed to my sense of Boston as a city full of wonder and mystery.</p>

<p>We want to thank Blue Bikes for their assistance with this puzzle, updating their website to make information needed to solve the puzzle more readily available. I also want to throw in a pitch for using the system. As a non-Bostonian who usually travels up for Hunt, Blue Bikes have in recent years become an essential part of my Hunt experience in getting me from my hotel to HQ faster than any other travel method. They don't cost a lot, they're fun to ride, and they get you around the city easily and quickly.</p>
