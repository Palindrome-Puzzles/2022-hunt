<p>This puzzle is about <strong>inductees into the
<a href="https://www.rockhall.com" target="_blank">Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame</a></strong> and
<strong><a href="https://codewithrockstar.com" target="_blank">Rockstar</a></strong>, a programming
language “designed for creating programs that are also hair metal power ballads”.</p>

<p>The sections of text look like song lyrics but are also marked up and formatted as source code.
Some of the “lyrics” sound fairly natural (many are actual song lyrics), but others sound rather
artificial, and a few use words that are common to programming like <code>let</code> and
<code>while</code>.</p>

<section>

<h2>Opener</h2>

<p>Here’s a brief overview of some Rockstar constructs used in the puzzle:</p>

<p>There are three types of <a href="https://codewithrockstar.com/docs#variables" target="_blank"><i>variables</i></a>
in Rockstar.
  <ul>
    <li><i>simple</i> variables: a single word, like <code>guitar</code></li>
    <li><i>common</i> variables: a modifier and a word, like <code>the guitar</code> or <code>my guitar</code>
      (the modifier is part of the name, so these two examples are <em>different</em>)</li>
    <li><i>proper</i> variables: multiple words, all capitalized, like <code>Jimi Hendrix</code></li>
  </ul>

  You can also use <a href="https://codewithrockstar.com/docs#pronouns" target="_blank"><i>pronouns</i></a>
  like <code><b>they</b></code> and <code><b>it</b></code> to refer to the most recently parsed variable.
</p>

<p>Rockstar has aliases for
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://codewithrockstar.com/docs#constants-vs-keywords" target="_blank"><i>constants</i></a>,
      so you can write <code><b>ok</b></code> and <code><b>lies</b></code> instead of
      <code><b>true</b></code> and <code><b>false</b></code></li>
    <li><a href="https://codewithrockstar.com/docs#operators" target="_blank"><i>operators</i></a>,
      so you can write <code><b>with</b> <b>without</b> <b>of</b> <b>over</b></code> instead of
      <code>+ - * /</code>.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://codewithrockstar.com/docs#literals-and-assignment" target="_blank"><i>assign</i></a>
to variables using
  <ul>
    <li><code><b>let</b> <i>variable</i> <b>be</b> <i>expression</i></code></li>
    <li><code><b>let</b> <i>variable</i> <b>be</b> <i>operation</i> <i>expression</i></code> to
      perform <a href="https://codewithrockstar.com/docs#compound-assignment-operators" target="_blank"><i>compound assignment</i></a>
      (<code>let x be with y</code> is <code>x += y</code>)</li>
    <li><code><b>put</b> expression <b>in</b>|<b>into</b> <i>variable</i></code></li>
    <li><code><i>variable</i> <b>say</b>|<b>says</b>|<b>said</b> <i>unquoted string</i></code></li>
    <li><code><i>variable</i> <b>is</b>|<b>are</b>|<b>was</b>|<b>were</b> <i>poetic value</i></code>,
      where the <i>poetic value</i> can be a <i>constant</i> or a
      <a href="https://codewithrockstar.com/docs#poetic-number-literals" target="_blank"><i>poetic number</i></a>,
      which forms a number whose digits are the lengths of the words in the phrase (modulo 10).</li>
  </ul>

  The contractions <code><b>'s</b></code> and <code><b>'re</b></code> are aliases for <code><b>is</b></code>.
</p>

<p><code><b>Rock</b></code> and <code><b>Roll</b></code> are
<a href="https://codewithrockstar.com/docs#queue-operations" target="_blank"><i>array/queue operations</i></a>.</p>

<p><code><b>Cast</b></code> and <code><b>burn</b></code> convert strings to numbers and numbers to unicode characters.</p>

<p>In Rockstar, you <code><b>listen</b></code> to
<a href="https://codewithrockstar.com/docs#inputoutput" target="_blank">input</a> and
<code><b>say</b>|<b>scream</b>|<b>shout</b>|<b>whisper</b></code> output.</p>

<h2>Inductees</h2>

<p>The first ten programs can be completed by filling in the blanks with the titles of songs by
a single Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame inductee. Rockstar language syntax and semantics help
constrain which songs can be used and where. Clues are also provided by song lyrics or references,
or parenthetical parts of titles (which do not affect the code, since parentheses are used for
<a href="https://codewithrockstar.com/docs#comments" target="_blank">comments in Rockstar</a>).
The list of initials below each code block should also help with discovering/confirming the list of
songs.</p>

<pre><code>Our dreams are resplendent vermilion, gleaming warmly
Thought is a path, not a destination
Reality is a tenacious, steadfast matter
The earth is solid
The oceans are transparent
My forge is a foundation
Our love is strong. True
Let it be of the earth
Burn it

Until our dreams are reality,
The cosmos is mysterious
Rock it
Roll it
Listen to your heart
If it's empty,
Break it down

Split it with silence of thought
While your heart is as big as the oceans
Roll your heart into your soul
Roll your heart into your voice
Let your soul be with your voice
Burn your soul with my forge
Cast your soul into the flames
Rock the cosmos with it

Build our dreams up
Unite the cosmos with our love
Whisper it</code></pre>

<p>The inductee programs end in an
<a href="https://codewithrockstar.com/docs#inputoutput" target="_blank">output statement</a>, each
printing an eight-digit number when run. The programs were given in alphabetical order by artist, so
they should be reordered before extraction. Each artist was inducted into the Hall of Fame in
a different, consecutive class year, so the outputs should be reordered chronologically (the final
program’s loop from 1986 to 1995 also helps clue/confirm this).</p>
