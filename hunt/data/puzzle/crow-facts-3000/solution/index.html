<h2>Step 2: Countries and Monsters</h2>
<p>The alphanumerics of the Crow Fact #s spell out KAIJU SONG. Either by questioning fans of the series or some relatively easy googling, solvers should come up with the song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiJylMyfu9I" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">Every Country Has a Monster</a> from Episode 1101.</p>
<p>After listening to the song, solvers should recognize that some of the Crow Facts are actually referring to the monsters from the song. Match up each fact with its monster and hopefully notice that the monsters are in alphabetical order, indicating that they need to be reordered somehow.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Crow Fact #11: Crow has a hut with some unusual legs, and there's something similar about his name. - Baba Yaga</li>
  <li>Crow Fact #1: Crow is outstanding in his field and he's got being scary in the... well... you know. - Bubak</li>
  <li>Crow Fact #9: If you saw Crow and then you saw a four footed beast, accented with horns like a deer, you might be experiencing deja vu. - Déélgééd</li>
  <li>Crow Fact #10: Crow has power over thunder and lightning, but before he uses it, he shouts "I'M CROW!" - Impundulu</li>
  <li>Crow Fact #21: Crow is the third in a line of ferocious monsters, all of which provide horrible sights to their captives. - Kinga</li>
  <li>Crow Fact #19: It takes one week for Crow to transform and rise out of a body of water. - Peng</li>
  <li>Crow Fact #15: Crow goes to great lengths to hide his very big feet. - Sasquatch</li>
  <li>Crow Fact #14.07: Crow has everything. He has the face of a cat, the body of a snake, and the blade of an army knife. - Tatzelwurm</li>
</ul>

<p>The solvers next step follows the song - solvers need to associate each of the monsters with a country. Each of those countries is present on the Google Map linked to in the texts, and has a bigram associated with it. When the solvers take those bigrams and order them by the order the monsters are in the song, it spells out NOW GO ONTO TWITTER.</p>

<h2>Step 3: The Twitter Account</h2>
<p>Searching a bit on Twitter will reveal <a href="https://twitter.com/crowfacts3000" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">@CrowFacts3000</a>. This Twitter account consists of 103 Crow Facts (and not 3103, as it may appear at first glance). Each of these facts can be sorted into one of eight categories depending on the word or words that the Crow Fact ends with. Each of these categories is clued by one of the Crow Facts from the Texting portion, which also gives the ordering of the categories. Count the number of tweets that are in each of the 8 categories and read them as alphanumerics to spell <span class="answer">REDWOODS</span> - another tall monster.</p>

    <h2>Author's Notes</h2>

    <p>This puzzle is a reference back to the puzzle <a href="https://www.mit.edu/~puzzle/2014/puzzle/crow_facts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">Crow Facts</a>, from the 2014 Hunt. That puzzle quickly became one of our favorite puzzles from that year, which is saying something given the overall quality of puzzles in 2014. However, if the absurdity of being texted ridiculous facts about crows wasn't enough, the two of us turned it into a <a href="https://twitter.com/BenMSmith/status/424817404946812928" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">Twitter</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/mersiamnot/status/424818048919281664" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">game</a>, where we ignored the Game of Thrones restriction and started tweeting out the most ridiculous facts about crows we could think of, pretending that there was a Twitter account that they were all coming from.</p>

    <p>So thank you Kristen Sunter and Quinn Mahoney for creating a puzzle that inspired us so much. We hope you had as much fun solving this as we did solving yours.</p>
