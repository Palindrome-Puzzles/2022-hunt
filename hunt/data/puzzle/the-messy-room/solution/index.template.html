<p>Each grid is a dropquote where the letters are either in the letter list above or below the grid. When solved, each produces a famous quote where the words are out of order, and each is missing a word.</p>

<p>The seven quotes (with missing words in brackets) are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any writer I suppose feels that the world into which he was born is <span class="extract">[nothing]</span> less than a conspiracy against the cultivation of his talent. - James Baldwin</li>
<li>I consider that a man's brain originally is like a little <span class="extract">[empty]</span> attic, and you have to stock it with such furniture as you choose. - Arthur Conan Doyle</li>
<li>In <span class="extract">[matters]</span> of truth and justice, there is no difference between large and small problems, for issues concerning the treatment of people are all the same. - Albert Einstein</li>
<li>In the beginning the <span class="extract">[universe]</span> was created. This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move. - Douglas Adams</li>
<li>We cast away priceless <span class="extract">[time]</span> in dreams born of imagination, fed upon illusion, and put to death by reality. - Judy Garland</li>
<li>When <span class="extract">[kindness]</span> has left people, even for a few moments, we become afraid of them as if their reason had left them. - Willa Cather</li>
<li>Without freedom of thought there can be no such thing as wisdom, and no such thing as <span class="extract">[public]</span> liberty without freedom of speech. - Benjamin Franklin</li>
</ul>

<p>After alphabetizing the missing words by the last names of the speakers and taking the first letters, you get the answer to this puzzle: <span class="answer">UNKEMPT</span>.</p>
